The translation should be natural while avoiding any awkward encounters. Moreover, the tone and writing style should be consistent throughout the document.
2. **Cultural Boundaries:**  The tone or words must not violate cultural norms and ethics. Some cultures are sensitive to specific content, while to some, it is no big deal. Hence, the translator should have background information on target cultures.
