![talk shop live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/is-talkshoplive-right-for-you-live-shop-pros-tips-before-you-start-1.jpg)

 The TalkShopLive studio app for brands and creators brings an array of broadcast and management tools to mobile. The platform boasts of enabling users to promote and sell their shows before and after going live. This means that you can create a shoppable and shareable video for promoting your show even before it goes live. Technically, you do not have to worry about the aftermath since your content will remain shoppable after the live streaming event comes to an end.

 You also get to do a whole range of other cool things with Talk Shop Live.

## Part 2: Who Can Benefit from Talkshoplive?

 Choosing TalkShopLive as your live shopping platform keeps you on the right track. In addition to getting access to a wider audience, you also become more competitive in the market. However, it can be time-consuming and expensive to live stream all the time. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) promises a simplified future for sellers and creators. In particular, AI streamers can be used as a powerful tool for live shopping.

 AI streamers are avatars that replicate human streamers, keeping your viewers engaged. They offer a unique advantage over traditional human hosts in that they are available 24/7 and work based on your product information. They also have multi-lingua and multi-tasking capabilities that allow you to serve diverse groups of audiences.
