It should be clear, with natural pronunciation and the right pitch and tone. Your listeners will be more likely to stay interested in your videos, lectures, or audiobooks if you have a natural voice.

### **2\. Multilingual Support**

Check that the voice generator covers the languages you will be working with and that generated sounds seem natural in each language.

Look for a voice generator that can pronounce words and phrases correctly and has an extensive pronunciation dictionary. Some voice generators also enable you to modify the pronunciation and allow you to adjust your generated sound according to your particular requirements.

### **4\. Intonation and Emphasis**

 Spoken language needs to use emphasis and intonation to express the emotions, meaning, and context of a statement.

Both factors help the narrator's voice generator effectively deliver the information. The narrator's voice generator must be able to modify intonation and emphasis to provide natural speech.
