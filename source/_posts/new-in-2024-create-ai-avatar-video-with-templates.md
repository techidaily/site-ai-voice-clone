On the other hand, customers interact with the live video by asking questions in the comment sections or chatting with hosts.

![amazon live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-1.jpg)

### 02 Who Can Benefit from Amazon Live?

 Amazon Live streaming sales focus on the desires of the shoppers to know more about a product. It is also based on the tendency of online shoppers to impulse buy. By providing instant answers to shoppers, sellers can minimize the guesswork and boost sales.

1. **Shoppers:** Discover new products and see them in demonstrated action before making a purchase. They can also ask questions in real time and get additional information.
2. **Seller and Brands:** Increased product awareness and sales with the potential for building brand image.

### 03 Is Amazon Live Streaming Right for You?

 Amazon Live is an effective tool for starting a major sale or increasing the overall awareness of your product. The program streams live videos on the Amazon Live homepage to your brand’s product details pages giving you more exposure. You can speak about your products or simply demonstrate how they work. This makes Amazon Live a highly engaging promotional tool that sellers and influencers can use to drive more informed shoppers to buy their products, Here are some pros and cons of using Amazon Sale live streaming:

#### Pros

* A free live-streaming platform for sellers
* Offers creative tools and resources to effectively promote your products
* Amazon Live selling is a small part of the growing market and offers the opportunity for brands to scale

#### Cons

* Low consumer engagement rates with low-quality videos
* You will still need a creative team with resources to represent your brand well
* Amazon Live is still a fledging service and does not offer influencer marketing nor have its own place on Amazon’s website navigation yet

## Part 2: Step Guidance: Getting Started with Amazon Live

 To create a livestream on Amazon, you need to be a U.S. Professional Seller either registered as a U.S. Vendor or in the Amazon Brand Registry. Sellers who meet the requirements can create their livestreams through the[Amazon Live Creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) mobile app.

![amazon live creator app](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-2.jpg)

 With Amazon streaming live service, you can record Livestream in advance and schedule them to go up at a later date or go Live in real-time. This will usually depend on your goals and the kind of interaction you want with your audience. In any case, Amazon recommends the use of an external camera and a video encounter instead of your mobile phone to ensure quality video. Although you can use either, an external camera gives you an edge in terms of quality. Let’s have a look at a detailed step-by-step guide to getting started with Amazon Live:

##### Step 1 Create an Amazon Live Account

 Download the[Amazon Live Creator app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) from the Apps Store. The app is currently only available for iOS and will work on iPhone or iPad. Sign into your Seller, Influencer, or Vendor account and create a Live Account.

![products ](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-5.jpg)

##### Step 4 Set Up Your Amazon Livestream

 With the product added, you are ready to set up your live stream. Take some time in the practice mode to familiarize yourself with the platform, and prepare your talking points. Also, come up with responses to possible customer questions and any other important information. Although Amazon Live is free, you can also consider using Amazon advertising to reach a wider audience.

![amazon livestream setup](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-6.jpg)

##### Step 5 Go Live

 Once everything is ready, enter your stream time and start time. You can view your analytics from the homepage and see how well the live stream is performing.

![amazon live analytics ](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-7.jpg)
