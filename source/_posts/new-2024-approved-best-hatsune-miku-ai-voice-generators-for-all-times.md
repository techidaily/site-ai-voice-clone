This removes any unnecessary or repeated words, making your subtitles crisp and concise. You can also download translated subtitles as SRT or TXT files and use them the way you want.

### Language Support

Virbo currently supports translation in the following languages:

 English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, Indonesian, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Italian, Korean, Thai, Filipino, Bengali, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Croatian, Romanian, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Malay, Slovak, Danish, Tamil, Polish, Greek, Finnish, Burmese, Urdu

![upload a photo on talking photo virbo](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/guide/windows/talking-photo-feature-1.jpg)

Step 3 **Add an audio animation to the photo**

Enter the **Text Script** you want to convert into audio. Alternatively, click the **Audio Script** button to upload a WAV or MP3 file or extract audio from the video. You can even live to record your own voice. The maximum audio duration is 2 minutes.

![enter the text script or audio on virbo talking photo](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/talking-photo-3.jpg)

Step 4 **Customize the audio settings (Optional)**

If you're using the Text Script option, you may need to customize audio settings like language, volume, speed, and pitch. Skip this step if you've already recorded an audio file.

![customize the talking phot text script](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/talking-photo-4.jpg)

Step 5 **Preview your talking photo and export it**

Before saving the video, tap the **Preview** button and proceed to record another voiceover if the outcome isn't impressive. But if you're happy with everything, tap the Export button to save the talking image video in 720p or 1080p MP4 resolution. It's that easy!
