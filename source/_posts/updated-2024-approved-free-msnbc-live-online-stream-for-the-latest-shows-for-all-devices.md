## Free MSNBC Live: Online Stream for the Latest Shows for All Devices

 MSNBC is amongst the top cable news networks especially on Facebook, edging even Fox News and CNN. It contains some of the hottest shows that are loved by most Americans. MSNBC delivers news, articles, videos, and TV shows for all devices and across all audiences.

 But being a paid service, it chases away a lot of the users. So, if you want to watch the MSNBC live stream free, we have got the perfect list of websites that will allow you to watch your favorite shows without spending credits or money.

## **Part 1:** Best 5 Free MSNBC Live Streaming Sites

### 1\. LiveNewsChat

 One aspect of LiveNewsChat that we did not like is that it has a lot of annoying pop-up ads. But the quality pays for the hindered user experience which makes LiveNewsChat one of the best platforms for**MSNBC live streaming free online.**

[Live HD TV](https://www.livehdtv.net/msnbc-news/) is amongst the nicest-looking websites on the list. However, it doesn’t just look nice but has a utility that would boost your user experience to the fullest. Aside from MSNBC, there are a plethora of other channels as well like CBC, ABC, CBS, and other news channels.

 What’s unique about Live HD TV is that it provides you with multiple servers for MSNBC, which means that you can switch the servers if one of the links is not working. The platform also displays ads minimally, with the player box not showing ads, which basically means that ads are nowhere to be found on this platform. So, if you want to**watch MSNBC live,** then there is no better choice than a platform like Live HD TV.

[STREAMFARE](https://streamfare.com/msnbc) takes things to the next level by providing the simplest experience you can demand. As soon as you enter the website, you are greeted with a video player that would instantly play the live MSNBC show.

 But what’s more interesting is that the video player and the servers that are used in this platform also allow you to have complete control over your video quality. Sure, you are not getting the 4K quality here but you can still control it up to 720p.

 There are advanced options too that are related to ad control, latency, and more. So, if you are ever having a problem on the platform, you can manually fix it. All in all, STREAMFARE is one of the best**MSNBC live streams free online** that you can experience and have fun watching.

[LiveNewsMag](https://www.livenewsmag.com/msnbc-news-live-stream/) has one of the prettiest website designs and it allows you to watch MSNBC Live for free. However, there’s a catch. You will need to experience ads since the website won’t even work even if you have an ad blocker installed and activated.

 However, you can join LiveNewsPro which will disable ads for your particular account on the platform. LiveNewsMag provides one of the fastest loading times and although you will be greeted with ads from time to time, you are still getting live news on MSNBC right in the LiveNewsMag platform.

[FreeInterTV](http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2565) is an all-in-one package that also displays MSNBC news online. It is a great platform and a free alternative to the original website. However, the magic of this platform is that it provides you with most TV channels from all across the world.

 The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

 Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.

#### Features

| **Aspects**         | Performance                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |

| **Quality**         | Up to 720p (HD) but usually 480p |
| **User Experience** | Confusing design                 |

Its model training focuses on neutral emotion to avoid strong emotional speech. Also, it addresses the challenges of out-of-domain style using the Unet network and AdaIN layer.

Users are not required to use reference speech if they plan to do one-shot voice cloning. Also, the requirement to manually enter statistics of duration is no longer essential. Only Linux users can install it with the correct TensorFlow and TensorFlow-addons versions.

### 7\. [Voice-Synthesis (smoke-trees)](https://github.com/smoke-trees/Voice-synthesis)

This approach creates a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. Then, it uses this audio for text-to-speech synthesis. SV2TTS excels with deep learning and uses a speaker encoder, synthesizer, and voice coder. It clones voices in real time with zero-shot learning. The repository identifies voices, and the synthesizer generates Mel-spectrograms from the text. Finally, the vocoder turns them into lifelike waveforms.

All you need to do is feed this repository your voice sample or custom voice, and it can synthesize a clone of it for you. You can also use a microphone to input your text commands through speech. There are also instructions given if you want to work with your own models on different datasets and language mediums.

### 8\. [VoiceSmith (dunky11)](https://github.com/dunky11/voicesmith)

VoiceSmith is an easy-to-use repository requiring no coding experience. It fine-tunes a pipeline based on Delightful TTS and UnivNet for single or many speakers. Users can opt from a proprietary 5000 speaker dataset with automatic text normalization. Windows and Linux are supported, and an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is for faster training. Docker is essential for seamless operation for users exploring **real-time voice cloning online**.

* Install Requirements:

A RAM of less than 8GB may not work well with it, so it’s better to use at least 8GB RAM. To use this repository on Linux, you are advised to install Docker Engine. Users also get to play around with an emotional 60-speaker dataset-trained model.

### 9\. [Voice Cloning App by BenAAndrew](https://github.com/BenAAndrew/Voice-Cloning-App)

This Python or Pytorch repository empowers users for effortless voice synthesis. You can enjoy automatic dataset creation, multi-language support, and easy remote training. It allows you to build datasets and proceed further by using a training model. The tool offers new datasets and lets you extend existing datasets for voice cloning. This simple approach elevates your experience of **real-time voice cloning on GitHub.**

In future improvements, this repository is expected to support AMD GPU for better performance. Also, it claims to improve its batch size estimation. You can run it on Windows 10 or Ubuntu 20.04 operating system with at least 5GB of required disk space.

### 10\. [Unet-TTS](https://github.com/CMsmartvoice/Unet-TTS)

Unet-TTS excels in unseen speaker and style transfer for one-shot voice cloning. It works in seconds to produce target audio through voice synthesis without fine-tuning. There are various speaking styles embedded in a seamless way. Its algorithm works on a skip-connected structure to capture speaker and utterance features. Users can get precise inferences of complex voice characteristics and speaking styles.

However, it’s still a challenging task to perform out-of-domain transfer. According to the similarity evaluation, the new model excels in speaker embedding and style modeling. The new model can also discover utterance-level details from the reference audio.
