3. AI lacks cultural understanding, leading to translations that sometimes don’t align with cultural differences.
4. Diverse speech patterns or accents often affect the accuracy of AI-generated subtitles.
5. AI tools still face difficulties with complex sentence structures

 Some AI translators like Wondershare Virbo offer high translation accuracy and support proofreading, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context.
