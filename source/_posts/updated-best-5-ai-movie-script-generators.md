Voice cloning technology uses a structured procedure to bring accurate results. The first step is to collect the data from the targeted audio recordings. The audio recordings include the speech of a particular person with different phrases and contexts. Afterward, the program extracts the distinctive features of the person’s voice. The features include voice tone, pitch, rhythm, intonation, and other properties.

After collecting the data, the AI technology creates a training dataset. This dataset includes the input text and audio recordings of the individual. Then AI technology learns to match the input text to audio recordings. Now, the program uses a neural network as a deep learning technique to clone a voice. This network helps the model train through the input text and given vocal properties of the person’s voice.

Once the model gets trained, it generates a cloned voice by managing its internal parameters. Afterward, final adjustments and refinements are made to bring you the perfect output in the form of audio samples.
