 One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand.

On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

## What Is an AI Video Maker? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1.**What is an AI video maker?**

AI video maker refers to a video creation tool that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automate or enhance various aspects of the video production process. These tools often integrate machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to perform tasks such as video editing, scene recognition, automated video generation, voiceover synthesis, and more.

With AI video makers, users can create professional-looking videos more efficiently and with less manual effort. These tools can analyze raw video footage, apply filters, add visual effects, generate subtitles, and even suggest relevant music or soundtracks based on the video's content. Some AI video makers can also create videos from scratch using provided assets, such as images and text, transforming them into dynamic and engaging visual presentations.

The use of AI in video creation has significantly simplified the process and made it accessible to individuals and businesses without specialized video editing skills. As AI technology advances, AI video makers will likely become even more sophisticated, allowing for more creative and innovative video productions.

## Part 2\. Any differences between an AI video maker and a generator?

Yes, there is a difference between an AI video maker and an AI video generator, although they are related concepts.

### 1\. AI Video Maker

An AI video maker is a software tool or platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to assist in video creation and editing. It provides users various automated features and tools to streamline video production. AI video makers typically offer functionalities such as automatic video editing, scene recognition, visual effects, subtitle generation, voiceover synthesis, and music suggestions. These tools are designed to make video creation more accessible and efficient for users, regardless of their level of expertise in video editing.

### 2\. AI Video Generator

On the other hand, an AI video generator is an AI system that can autonomously produce videos from scratch without human intervention. These generators use AI algorithms, often powered by deep learning techniques, to create videos based on specific input parameters or data. For example, an AI video generator could take images, text, or audio inputs and use them to generate a complete video sequence. The generated videos may be entirely fictional or based on real-world data, depending on the system's design and purpose.

In summary, the main difference lies in their primary functions: an AI video maker assists users in the video creation process. In contrast, an AI video generator autonomously produces videos without human intervention. Both concepts leverage AI technology to enhance video-related tasks, but they serve different purposes and cater to other use cases. challenges they may present.
