 One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

 As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

### 1.[Oxfam](https://youtube/wuDQIjGRCfg.com)

 Whiteboard animation may still be effective whether it's for entertainment, marketing, or education. But it's also capable of addressing weightier issues. This describes the situation with the Oxfam International video. Raising awareness of the predicament of women worldwide is the task they confront.

### 2. [Unilever Series](https://youtu.be/qw6Vuz70tZE)

 Despite the fun and enjoyable material, Unilever uses the ads to convey a serious message: there is a need for men's hair and skin care. This is a fantastic illustration of how an animated whiteboard can be utilized to boost engagement and foster customer loyalty. The short, hilarious, and emotional videos are all three. An observer observes one and desires to observe others.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-unilever.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-unilever.jpg)

### 3.[Where Good Ideas Come from:](https://youtu.be/NugRZGDbPFU)

 This video addresses Steven Johnson's Where Good Ideas Come From, which examines the history of invention, using the conventional hand-drawn whiteboard format. What's important to note is that the video was specifically made to explain the fundamental thesis of the book and is not in any way self-promotional. This is echoed in the last frame of the illustration, as the camera pans out to show us the whole artwork.

![whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg)

 The capacity of whiteboard videos to simplify a difficult procedure is what distinguishes them from other animated explainer videos. The way that this specific video develops is fascinating. Since they are presented as logically related to one another, the concepts flow consistently and are simple to understand. As a result, we are motivated to read more of the book, which supports the assumption that the concepts being presented are part of a system.

### 4.[Content 2020 by Coca Cola](https://youtu.be/LyDf-twhpCo)

 Perhaps the finest whiteboard animation video to ever be posted online was Content 2020 by Coca-Cola. Long animations might sometimes be the greatest option for a company. This video is lengthier than the typical 2-minute explainer video since it discusses a new marketing plan that the firm has adopted. It is the ideal illustration of the rule that the longer your video, the more devoted your audience must be.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-coca-cola.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-coca-cola.jpg)

The animation describes Coca-Cola's new approach and emphasizes providing content that is relevant, worthwhile, and shareable. To convey the company's message, the scenes in this

### 5.[MedVector](https://youtu.be/p5LnKLRrz7M)

 MedVector employees make use of the whiteboard format to instruct visitors on how their product might benefit the clinical trial business. The video explains the service's many features and demonstrates how easy it is to use. To highlight the advantages of MedVector services, the video combines speech, basic animations, and hand-drawn images.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-medvector.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-medvector.jpg)

 Compared to the other videos we've seen, this one is a little different. It doesn't concentrate on a certain plot, despite the animated characters that give it charm. Instead, it addresses the issue at hand—how to obtain participants for medical trials—head-on. This kind of animation engages viewers by allowing them to concentrate on the key elements of your solution.

### 6.[ESPN – Interview:](https://youtu.be/coVVbk9kwVM)
