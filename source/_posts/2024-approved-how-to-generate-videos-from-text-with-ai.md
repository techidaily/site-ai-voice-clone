## Part 3\. Tips for Writing Prompts To Generate Videos From Text

 The key to**creating AI videos from text** is a good prompt. Unlike text-to-image generators, creating video prompts needs greater detail and clarity. With a good prompt, you can effectively guide the AI model in understanding the desired visual elements, narrative structure, and emotional context of the video.

 Here, we list a few tips to create good prompts for generating videos from text:

1. **Provide context**

 When crafting your AI video prompt, include specific information such as desired style, target audience, intended platform for posting (e.g., YouTube), and preferred tone (e.g., casual or formal). You can also indicate if you want high-definition video, like 4K videos.

1. **Be clear and specific**

 Although providing details is important, avoid unnecessary things that could confuse AI text-to-video generators. Keep your prompt clear and focused to ensure the AI understands your instructions accurately.

1. **Use descriptive language**

 Given that the AI will transform your text into videos, use descriptive language to depict characters, settings, actions, and objects vividly. This will help the AI create a more accurate representation of your vision.

1. **Incorporate keywords**

 Some AI video prompt platforms may support the use of tags or keywords to help generate video according to our intent. Use these keywords to influence the AI's output effectively.

1. **Structure the prompt effectively**

 Organize your prompt in a logical manner to ensure clarity and coherence. Start with an introductory sentence that summarizes the main idea or theme of the video. Then, break down the key elements or scenes you want to include.

 Moreover, pay attention to scene transitions. In case you need multiple scenes, make sure they transition smoothly to maintain a coherent flow when**generating videos from text** .

### Limitations

Despite how many features Descript offers, there are still some limitations to using this tool. In the following section, we have highlighted some of these:

* Descript doesn't have a mobile app for editing videos. Many users find it convenient to record and edit content on a smartphone rather than on a desktop.
* This tool can sometimes be a bit slow, especially on a MacBook. While this is common for video editing tools, it can be irritating while making videos.
* While you can find various templates within the Descript library, the options are not flexible. Users are unable to find different options to choose template themes.
* Although the transcription quality is generally great, it always needs some post-editing. Descript does not automatically update all changes of a word after fixing it in the transcript.

### Pricing Plans

The pricing plan of Descript is very reasonable for content creators and provides valuable features with each plan. No matter if you are a beginner or a professional, the **Descript overdub** feature will help you with content creation tasks:

| Pricing Plan | Price         |
