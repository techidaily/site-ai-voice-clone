With the continuous improvement of computer hardware and processing capabilities, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and cloud computing technologies, AI tools can perform complex computations faster and more accurately. This provides a robust infrastructure for the development and utilization of AI tools.

##### **03**of 05Progress in algorithms and models

Algorithms and models in the field of AI have been continuously evolving and improving. For example, the rise of deep learning models enables computers to better process complex data types such as images, speech, and natural language. These advancements enable AI tools to handle and analyze data with greater accuracy and efficiency.

##### **04**of 05Business needs and competitive pressures

Businesses face increasingly fierce competition and ever-changing market demands. AI tools offer an innovative and intelligent way to address these challenges. By leveraging AI tools, organizations can optimize their operations, improve products and services, and enhance their competitiveness.

##### **05**of 05Drive from scientific research

The investment in AI technology by academia and research institutions has been a driving force behind the development of AI tools. The efforts and innovations of researchers have propelled advancements in algorithms and models, providing a theoretical and practical foundation for the development of AI tools.

In conclusion, the emergence of AI tools is the result of multiple factors interacting, including the growth of data, advancements in hardware and computing power, progress in algorithms and models, as well as business needs, and the drive from scientific research. These background factors collectively contribute to the development and application of AI tools.

## Part 3\. How to treat AI tools?
