Compared to traditional avatar representations, AI avatars are more "human-like." Their most notable characteristic is their possession of human-like appearance. AI avatars are designed to resemble human beings in their appearance, including facial features, expressions, and body movements. This helps create a sense of familiarity and relatability for users. Hence, they are interactive and responsive, as well as capable of understanding and responding to user inputs, whether through text, speech, or gestures. They can engage in conversations, answer questions, and provide relevant information or assistance.

Meanwhile, AI avatars also have the ability to learn adaptively and can learn from user interactions and adapt their responses over time. They can improve their understanding, language capabilities, and behavior based on user feedback, making their interactions more effective and tailored to individual preferences.

Moreover, AI avatars have great advantages, such as 24/7 availability and consistency. They can be available round the clock, providing assistance and information anytime. This ensures continuous support and access to services without limitations imposed by human availability. In the meantime, they can maintain a consistent tone, language, and behavior across interactions, eliminating variations that may occur with human operators.

## Part 3\. What's the application area of AI avatars?
