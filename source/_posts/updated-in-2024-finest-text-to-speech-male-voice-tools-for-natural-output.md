* **Monthly Plan.** $9.9/month - The plan grants you access to 10 minutes of video credits every month. It’s ideal for occasional video translations.
* **Yearly Plan – Essential** . $19.9/year - This plan gives you 22 minutes of video credits annually. It caters to moderate translation needs for Tamil videos.
* **Yearly Plan – Pro** . $199/year – The pro plan is for heavy users and businesses looking to translate a significant volume of Tamil videos. It offers a generous 300 minutes of video credits per year.

 Additionally, the Monthly Plan supports videos of up to 2 minutes long. Meanwhile, both Yearly Plans allow for videos of up to 5 minutes. Regardless of your plan, they all have a maximum resolution of 1080p and unlimited time for AI scripts.

## Part 3\. Other Methods to Translate in Tamil

 There are alternative methods available if you prefer different English to Tamil translate approaches. Yet, it’s important to note that these methods cater to text translation. They may not capture the nuances and context of video content. Let’s explore two common alternatives:

### Google Translate

 Google Translate is a well-known tool for translating text from one language to another, such as**English to Tamil translation** . Here’s how you can use it for basic translation:

* **Step 1** : Visit the Google Translate website or open the Google Translate app. Select the input and output languages (e.g., English to Tamil).

![video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg)

* **Step 2** : Type or paste the text you want to translate into the provided box. Google Translate will instantly translate the text into Tamil.

 Remember that Google Translate may not always produce the most accurate translations. It’s especially evident for complex sentences or specialized terminology.

### YouTube Video Translation

 YouTube offers a built-in feature for translating video titles and descriptions. It can also generate subtitles in many languages, including languages from English to Tamil. Here’s how you can use it:

* **Step 1** : Upload your video to YouTube and navigate to the video’s editing page. Click the**Subtitles/CC** tab.
* **Step 2** : Select the language you want to translate your subtitles into (e.g., Tamil). YouTube will automatically generate machine-translated subtitles.
* **Step 3** : Review and edit the translated subtitles to ensure accuracy and coherence.

**YouTube’s video translation in Tamil** feature can be helpful at times. But, it may not capture the nuances or cultural context accurately. Manual editing is often required to refine the translations. This is important to ensure they align with the original video content.

## Conclusion
