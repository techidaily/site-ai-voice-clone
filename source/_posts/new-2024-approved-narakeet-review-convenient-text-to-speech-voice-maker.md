 There are alternative methods available if you prefer different English to Tamil translate approaches. Yet, itâ€™s important to note that these methods cater to text translation. They may not capture the nuances and context of video content. Letâ€™s explore two common alternatives:

### Google Translate

 Google Translate is a well-known tool for translating text from one language to another, such as**English to Tamil translation** . Hereâ€™s how you can use it for basic translation:

* **Step 1** : Visit the Google Translate website or open the Google Translate app. Select the input and output languages (e.g., English to Tamil).

![video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg)

* **Step 2** : Type or paste the text you want to translate into the provided box. Google Translate will instantly translate the text into Tamil.

 Remember that Google Translate may not always produce the most accurate translations. Itâ€™s especially evident for complex sentences or specialized terminology.

### YouTube Video Translation

 YouTube offers a built-in feature for translating video titles and descriptions. It can also generate subtitles in many languages, including languages from English to Tamil. Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

* **Step 1** : Upload your video to YouTube and navigate to the videoâ€™s editing page. Click the**Subtitles/CC** tab.
* **Step 2** : Select the language you want to translate your subtitles into (e.g., Tamil). YouTube will automatically generate machine-translated subtitles.
* **Step 3** : Review and edit the translated subtitles to ensure accuracy and coherence.

**YouTubeâ€™s video translation in Tamil** feature can be helpful at times. But, it may not capture the nuances or cultural context accurately. Manual editing is often required to refine the translations. This is important to ensure they align with the original video content.

![live selling and how to perform](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-live-selling-in-todays-work-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. A Basic Preview To "Live Shopping"

**Livestream selling** or live shopping refers to live product demonstrations on digital platforms. The retailer or host has to introduce themselves, their store, and sale before describing products. They explain each detail of the products and their prices while holding them in a direct video call. During that, ensure that followers can see the product and interact through comments.

 Customers perceive it as a lively shopping experience instead of websites loading products. It creates a sense of connection as people feel like shopping in physical stores. As**live selling** has a core element of being in real time, people can question and know about the product. Compared with traditional shopping, one can place an order through links mentioned in the livestream.

### Is It Beneficial To Sell Live in This Digital Industry?

 Live selling is an emerging way to attract customers to shop on online marketplaces. According to[research](#:~:text=76%25%20of%20US%20adults%20shop,at%20least%20once%20per%20week.) , 76% of US adults prefer shopping online for clothes and groceries. It focuses on customersâ€™ desire to know about products that generate sales. Thus, it proves beneficial in many terms, among which a few are elaborated below:

#### 1\. Engaging and Updating Communication

 Businesses can directly engage with a broader audience by entering the live selling industry. They get knowledge about current product trends to introduce similar things. Besides, this method eliminates the need to target customers in-store or via e-mails. Now, businesses can market their product and live sales simultaneously.

#### 2\. Reduced Return Rates and Customer Satisfaction

 Before live selling, people need to search for what they want by visiting the official sites of brands. Also, they scroll to read honest product reviews for the validity of products. With live selling, customers can view the products and ask questions during the live sessions. Therefore, it lowers the return rates to 40% while increasing customer satisfaction and trust.

#### 3\. Potential Growth and Virtual Demonstrations

 This online shopping mode has the potential to upscale your business. According to a survey, companies can see top-line growth upward of 25% through live selling.

### 1\. Livestream Selling Platform

 To expand the product's reach, it is essential to carefully select an**online live selling** platform. It could be a native live shopping platform, social media, or merchant website. As Gen Z and millennials are more attracted to live streaming, social media platforms would be ideal hosts. Many brands are integrating social media with e-commerce to cut the need for two separate apps.

### 2\. Real-Time Session With Host

 Upon choosing a suitable platform, a live video session is arranged. For that purpose, you need a host who should seem trustworthy and relatable to the product. There could be more than one person in the live sale to demonstrate products and share tips and benefits. Besides, the host needs to interact with the customers and share thoughts about the product.

### 3\. Points of Product or Video Content

 The main object of live selling is to sell products, but the best way is to create hype. In this regard, brands offer special discounts and giveaways valid only during live streams. It increases the tendency of customers to make purchases during the live sessions. The live session must be 20-30 minutes and include click-on links for easy buying.

### 2\. Pick an Appropriate Date and Time

 Another tip to consider is choosing the right time and date for the maximum viewers. In this regard, retailers should avoid a popular shopping period such as Black Friday. In contrast, it is suggested to pick weekends or holidays where customers must be free to join. Also, never choose the working hours of any day and consider the time zones for a global audience.

### 3\. Keep the Conversation Engaging and Funny

 Customers can read the product details and see how it looks, so what difference will they get from a live sale? Considering this perspective, sellers should bring something unique to the shopping stream. For this purpose, they can explain the product's benefits and use cases. Furthermore, they should keep their tone friendly and humorous for the targeted audience.
