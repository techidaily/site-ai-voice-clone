Traditional methods rely on developers manually adjusting game elements based on feedback.

While AI game generators offer numerous advantages regarding efficiency, speed, and innovation, it's important to recognize that they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. They excel in automating certain tasks and enhancing creativity, but they are most effective when used with human expertise to create well-balanced and engaging gaming experiences.
