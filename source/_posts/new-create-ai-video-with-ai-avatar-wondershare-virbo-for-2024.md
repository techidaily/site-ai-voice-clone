## **Part 1: Best 10 Animated Explainer Video Examples**

 Videos may be used as a tool to grow an audience's loyalty, enhance conversions, or draw in new clients. It's a fantastic approach to increase brand recognition and customer loyalty. To learn how other companies have created explainer films, we advise viewing some of the greatest ones currently available. These 10 explainer video examples are ones we recently came across and would want to share with you. Let's think about these wonderful videos and why we love them without further ado.

### 1. [Microsoft Office 365](https://youtu.be/RH26Ncrvwsw)

![best-explainer-video-examples-microsoft.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-microsoft.jpg)

 Although Microsoft does not need an introduction, its services or products do. The full functionality of Office 365 is described in this video. We are aware that the simplicity of this video animation is precisely what we like about it. The explainer film made by the Microsoft team is the ideal example of what one should include.

 With the help of amazing characters, this 30-second animation showcases Microsoft Whiteboard's advantages and shows how to use it. The reason In a Nutshell is at the top of our list of the best animated explainer films is because they consistently provide the most aesthetically attractive videos.

### 2. [Making Teamwork Click](https://youtu.be/l-7awVpecvU)

![best-explainer-video-examples-teamwork.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-teamwork.jpg)

 You know why this is one of the finest explanation videos we've ever seen? the animated explainer backdrop. There is no question about the quality of the animation, but pay attention to how the music precisely reflects the development of the narrative and gives it a new depth without interfering with the narration.

 Each year, businesses produce tens of thousands of explainer films, some of which are excellent and some of which are among the greatest ever made. Making Teamwork Click is just one of them. The basic backdrop and figures used here wonderfully complement the animation, which keeps your focus on the app.

### 3.[Ahrefs](https://youtu.be/krzF3YhmSMw)

![best-explainer-video-examples-ahrefs.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-ahrefs.jpg)

 Ahrefs is a collection of SEO tools. In terms of managing SEO, the video demonstrates how to utilize and benefit from the tool. An adorable and enjoyable animation goes horizontally to the right as the pieces in the Ahrefs explanation video leap up and down on the screen. Cool cinematography with a horizontal pan to the right, cute effects, and smooth transitions. There is creative typography on it.

 Ahrefs has effectively disproven the notion that a company's brand is too corporate for animated explainer films. This animated software demo film demonstrates that combining stylish transitions with educational material is a pretty smart concept. We believe that this video's straightforwardness makes the use of animation ideal for the message it is trying to express.

### 4. [McDonald’s Going Tech](https://vimeo.com/363361640)

![best-explainer-video-examples-mcdonalds.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-mcdonalds.jpg)

 This explainer video is in a distinct manner. Although it's difficult to construct an animated explanation video, McDonald's smooth animation makes it seem possible. To help users understand how to redeem offers on the McDonald's app, a humorous, daring character-driven explainer video animation was produced. The basic backdrop and figures used here wonderfully complement the animation, which keeps your focus on the app.

 Since videos that make viewers feel something are quite popular, we had to include this one on our list. Videos that evoke emotion in the viewer tend to be very popular, which is why we had to have this video on our list.

### 5. [Purina One](https://youtu.be/Em2zX9pDDI0)

![best-explainer-video-examples-purina-one.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-purina-one.jpg)

 The greatest illustrated characters are those that are specifically made for a company. While the voiceover promotes Purina cat food, the cat and its owner are amicable and attractive to look at. We're certain that this is one of our greatest animated explainer films since it has a properly written narrative, a lively vocal, and eye-catching image.

 Your video marketing plan won't be the same after you comprehend the power of videos and can determine if a certain video is beneficial or not. Acknowledging your errors also helps. This explainer film is the ideal demonstration of what a 2D animated explainer video looks like. Despite the app's specialized purpose, its designers continue to convey their essential points via 2D animation. And it looks fantastic!

### 6.[Meet Asana](https://youtu.be/jY0-gsNImlk)

![best-explainer-video-examples-meet-asana.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-meet-asana.jpg)

 Explainer videos that are animated give you a lot of creative flexibility. Just take a look at this example's fantastic style; it is so distinctive that the writing is immediately unforgettable. This proves that your video style can be customized to meet your tone and image regardless of the sector you work in.

 When it comes to producing the best animation, these people consistently outperform the competition, particularly when animation is used to promote the introduction of their most recent goods. In this film, live-action footage is mixed with quirky animated text and graphics.

 This next video was produced by the Slack team. This is another contender for the best explainer video that explains the ins and outs of intangible things using animated characters or objects for marketers. The usage of the brand's colors to make this item instantly recognized and memorable improves it even more.

 The Slack marketing team done a terrific job of simplifying their sophisticated software solution into an engaging explanation film. The Slack team produced an animated explainer film that is both true to their brand and appropriate for a current audience by combining their chosen color scheme with contemporary iconography and smooth transitions.

![best-explainer-video-examples-honest-gorilla.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-honest-gorilla.jpg)

 Next, we have an excellent example of 2D video animation. This animated film was made for HonestGorilla, an energy firm that encourages customers to compare energy providers rather than just choosing the first one they see. It's funny, educational, and snappy; everything a good video animation should be.

 Each scenario in this film is realistic, with animation serving merely as a supplemental technique. Because of its vibrant visual aesthetic and amazing level of information, it is straightforward, peaceful but intriguing, and stunning.

Nevertheless, the people at Cisco are able to do so effectively because of the educational effectiveness of explainer films. This clip does a great job of taking us on a trip while clearly articulating the issue it answers as well as the solution itself.
