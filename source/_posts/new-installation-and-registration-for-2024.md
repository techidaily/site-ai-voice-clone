## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)

### 02 Who Can Benefit from Amazon Live?

 Amazon Live streaming sales focus on the desires of the shoppers to know more about a product. It is also based on the tendency of online shoppers to impulse buy. By providing instant answers to shoppers, sellers can minimize the guesswork and boost sales.

5. **Anyone Seeking Entertainment** : Amazon Livestream can be a source of entertainment with DIY projects and demonstrations.

### 03 Is Amazon Live Streaming Right for You?

 Amazon Live is an effective tool for starting a major sale or increasing the overall awareness of your product. The program streams live videos on the Amazon Live homepage to your brand’s product details pages giving you more exposure. You can speak about your products or simply demonstrate how they work. This makes Amazon Live a highly engaging promotional tool that sellers and influencers can use to drive more informed shoppers to buy their products, Here are some pros and cons of using Amazon Sale live streaming:

#### Pros

* A free live-streaming platform for sellers
* Offers creative tools and resources to effectively promote your products
* Amazon Live selling is a small part of the growing market and offers the opportunity for brands to scale

#### Cons

* Low consumer engagement rates with low-quality videos
* You will still need a creative team with resources to represent your brand well
* Amazon Live is still a fledging service and does not offer influencer marketing nor have its own place on Amazon’s website navigation yet

## Part 2: Step Guidance: Getting Started with Amazon Live

 To create a livestream on Amazon, you need to be a U.S. Professional Seller either registered as a U.S. Vendor or in the Amazon Brand Registry. Sellers who meet the requirements can create their livestreams through the[Amazon Live Creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) mobile app.

![amazon live creator app](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-2.jpg)

 With Amazon streaming live service, you can record Livestream in advance and schedule them to go up at a later date or go Live in real-time. This will usually depend on your goals and the kind of interaction you want with your audience. In any case, Amazon recommends the use of an external camera and a video encounter instead of your mobile phone to ensure quality video. Although you can use either, an external camera gives you an edge in terms of quality. Let’s have a look at a detailed step-by-step guide to getting started with Amazon Live:

##### Step 1 Create an Amazon Live Account

 Download the[Amazon Live Creator app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) from the Apps Store. The app is currently only available for iOS and will work on iPhone or iPad. Sign into your Seller, Influencer, or Vendor account and create a Live Account.

![amazon live log in](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-3.jpg)

##### Step 2 Enter Details of your Product or Brand

 Choose your brand and enter the desired profile name. Edit your profile the way you like to be a true representation of your brand.

![brand information ](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-4.jpg)

![products ](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-5.jpg)

##### Step 4 Set Up Your Amazon Livestream

 With the product added, you are ready to set up your live stream. Take some time in the practice mode to familiarize yourself with the platform, and prepare your talking points. Also, come up with responses to possible customer questions and any other important information. Although Amazon Live is free, you can also consider using Amazon advertising to reach a wider audience.

![amazon livestream setup](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-6.jpg)

##### Step 5 Go Live

 Once everything is ready, enter your stream time and start time. You can view your analytics from the homepage and see how well the live stream is performing.

![amazon live analytics ](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-7.jpg)
