* Step 5\. Add Script for Livestream Video

 To add the script for the live stream video, you are provided with 3 different scenarios. If you intend to have more human interaction, go to the respective section. Select the appropriate sub-section through which you want to interact with your audience. If you go for "Text," add the text, which will be limited to 1000 words or less. Set up the dubbing audio using the respective option on the top.

 On the other hand, you can define the language through the "Translate to" menu and click "Translate." If you are not going to translate the text, click "Add text" to conclude by adding the script for the live stream video.
