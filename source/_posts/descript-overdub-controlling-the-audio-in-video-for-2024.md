Our recommended Eminem voice changers can replicate the celebrity's voice with amazing accuracy.

## **Part 1\. Who is Eminem and What Does He Do?**

 Eminem (Marshall Bruce Mathers III) will feature highly on the list when mentioning legendary musicians. Eminem is an American-born rapper born in 1972\. He is credited for helping popularize hip-hop and is among the best-selling rappers of the 20th and 21st centuries. It's estimated that Eminem has worldwide sales of over 220 million records and was the best-selling musician in the US in the early 2000s.
