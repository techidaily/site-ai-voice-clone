In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

That’s kind of what latency is like in**real-time video translation** . There’s a short delay between what’s spoken and the translated text appearing. For critical conversations, consider using pre-recorded videos with translated subtitles or voiceovers.

Supported Languages

 Apps that translate videos in real-time are getting better at handling a wider range of languages, but some are more supported than others. Check the app you’re considering and the languages it supports. If your language isn’t on the list, you might need to look for alternative solutions.

## What Is an AI Art Generator?

## Part 3: Best Alternatives To Google Translate

 Below are some alternatives you can use if Google Translate is unavailable. These options are just as good, if not better.

### 1\. Virbo

[Translate Video Online](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/virbo/download/) [Download APP Now](https://app.adjust.com/11acwaj1%5F11ig9sc4) [Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/virbo/download/)



 We previously mentioned [Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/app/video-translate) for burning subtitles on your Video. But you can also use it to translate a video, edit subtitles, create instant dubs/voiceovers, make AI avatar videos and do so much more. It is a great option if you want a host of features to streamline your content creation process besides mere subtitle translation. Virbo is available on all major platforms, such as Online Browsers, PC/Laptop, Android, and iOS devices.

### 2\. Microsoft Translator

![Microsoft Translator](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/google-translate-a-video-05.jpg)

[Microsoft Translator](https://translator.microsoft.com/) is another great option for video translation. It allows real time translated conversations across multiple devices and platforms. Another difference between Google and Microsoft Translator is that Microsoft’s Translator supports fewer languages. It’s only available for 103 languages, which is still more than big name translation services. A unique feature of Microsoft Translator is that it is also compatible with the MS Office suite. So you can use it with MS Excel, One Note, PowerPoint and Outlook. Lastly, this tool is particularly helpful with contextual understanding of a sentence.

### 3\. SubtitleBee

![SubtitleBee Mainpage](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/google-translate-a-video-06.jpg)

[SubtitleBee](https://subtitlebee.com/) is also a great service to quickly translate and add subtitles to online videos. With a reported accuracy rate of 95%, this service is among some of the most accurate in the market. Moreover, it allows you to customize subtitles, edit and add cool font styles, colors, background details and orientation to create your unique projects. Another great feature is that with SubtitleBee you can add subtitles anywhere on screen. Even on top, if you so want. It also has a supertitles feature as a bonus, which enables you to add head titles on videos.

## Part 4: FAQs about Google Translate Video Audio

**1\. Can I translate a full video with Google Translate?**

 Of course, you can use Google Translate to get the translation of any length video. You will first have to transcribe the entire audio and then translate that transcript with the help of Google Video. You can use services like Virbo to add these translated subtitles to the original video.

**2\. Does Google Translate really work for video translation?**

 Well, Google Translate does not directly translate a video. You have to integrate it with other services like YouTube to get translation and then use Google Translate as a secondary tool to translate a video.

**3\. Can I get a translated video in my native language?**

 Yes, Google Translate supports almost 133 languages of the world. If your native language is spoken by a large population, chances are Google supports its translation to and from other languages. So, you can get a translated video in your native language.

**4\. What languages does Google Translate support?**

 Google Translate supports approximately 133 languages of the world at the moment. But it keeps on adding new language support every once in a while. You can get translations in all popular languages like English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, Hindi, Italian, Russian, Korean, etc.

## Conclusion

 That’s pretty much all about translating a video using Google Translate. Tools like Google Translate and Wondershare Virbo make our world more connected than ever. They bridge boundaries and bring people together. But, don’t forget, if you are translating any copyrighted content with Google Translate, you may need permission. Translating copyrighted content without permission is still copyright infringement. Use these tools with responsibility. Now, go on,**Google Translate video online** . Good luck!
