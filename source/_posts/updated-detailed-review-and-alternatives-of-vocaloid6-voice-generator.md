## [Update] 6 Best Voice Changers You Can't Miss

**AI voice changer** is a modern software trained using machine learning to modify and mimic authentic human voices in live or pre-recorded audio. A voice-changing app can help you sound like a robot, cartoon character, celebrity, monster, and more. Therefore, these programs can be handy in industries like video gaming, telecommunications, podcasting, and more.

 Sadly, finding the perfect tool could be challenging in a world filled with**AI voice changers** . But worry not because we have done some deep research to help you find the most advanced AI voice-changing apps to use. We will review these apps based on their key attributes and the ability to generate varying AI voices. Keep scrolling!

## **Part 1\. Why do you need AI voice changers?**

 First, let’s start by listing some reasons why you need an AI voice changer app. As mentioned, there are many reasons to use an AI-powered voice changer as this program can unlock endless possibilities.

* **Entertainment and fun:** Are your friends often pranking you with videos and audio recordings? You can score one against them by recording a prank audio or video using an AI voice changer tool.
* **Content creator:** Are you a content creator on YouTube, TikTok, Reels, and other platforms? You can use AI voice to create high-quality content with fun and engaging narrations. AI voices can also help create top-quality podcasts.
