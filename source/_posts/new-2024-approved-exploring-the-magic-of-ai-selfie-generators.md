#### 2\. How to select a niche for a YouTube channel?

 One of the basic yet irritating confusions YouTubers face is selecting a niche for their YouTube content. It is quite a big decision, and you have to be very careful on this part. Identify your interests initially for selecting the niche you can rely on without boredom.
