 After learning about setting up a Facebook shop, you should look into some tips for settling down in the market. Thus, the following are some strategies that you need to focus on before**selling live on Facebook** :

### 1\. Promote Your Shopping Event

 Build anticipation of your event a couple of days before. Following that, announce or promote your event and encourage people to subscribe to your page. You can invite them via other channels like Instagram posts, blogs, and social media groups.

### 2\. Keep It Short and Engaging

 Consider the first few minutes of the live event important. Show an energetic attitude and grab the audience's attention initially. According to research, social media users prefer to watch videos in under 1 minute.

### 3\. Plan Things and Be Organized

 It is better to plan your points of discussion before the event. You should write the outline and transition lines to shift from one product to another. Besides, keep your surroundings organized to give viewers a good impression.

### 4\. Energetically Communicate

 Make your audience as much involved in the event as you can. For this, it is suggested that they respond to their questions and ask them to comment. You can show your product trials and ask a friend or family to create more engaging discussions.

### 5\. Don’t Let Your Work Wasted

 You should not let your**Facebook live online selling** sessions be wasted. Save it in your timeline for people to watch anytime and get information about items. It will also attract new audiences who couldn't join the live session.
