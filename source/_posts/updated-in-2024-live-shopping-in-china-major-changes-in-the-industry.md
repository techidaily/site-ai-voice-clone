## Part 1\. The Basic Concept of Livestream Shopping: What It Is?

 Livestream shopping is a practice that involves product promotion through a live video. This innovative concept creates an engaging environment for shopping through live video entertainment.

### 1\. Video Equipment

 You need a fine camera to ensure clear video for high-quality product display. Also, there should be a tripod stand to keep this camera stable and cover multiple angles. You may also use ring lights or LED panels, as good lighting is crucial for better visibility.

### 2\. Audio Equipment
