 If possible, avoid videos with multiple speakers or overlapping dialogue. Clear, single-speaker content facilitates more accurate and efficient translation.

1. **The video resolution must be of good quality**

 Aim for a video resolution ranging between 360x360 and 1920x1920 pixels. This ensures optimal visual clarity and compatibility with the translation process.

1. **Upload videos without subtitles initially**

 When uploading your video, refrain from including subtitles initially. It helps to create a more precise and tailored translation and ensures that the text aligns with the video content.
