### 4\. Education and Socioeconomic Factors

 Certain accents have been associated with distinct socioeconomic factors. Higher levels of education are often associated with more standardized and prestigious accents. Other influences such as occupation, social identity, and community also play a key role in determining the varying accents of individuals.

 Linguistic drift is a natural process that helps languages evolve. Like most languages, English has also undergone linguistic drift.
