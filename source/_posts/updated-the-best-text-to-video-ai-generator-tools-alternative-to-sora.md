## Part 1: What is Voice Cloning?

Voice cloning is a procedure in which a program generates an identical voice of a real person through speech synthesis. This technology uses deep learning strategies and AI to replicate a human voice through audio recordings. To clone a voice, there are several **voice cloning apps** comprising distinctive properties.

The voice cloning software analyzes the speech patterns, pitch, tone, and other vocal properties of the targeted human. Voice cloning has various uses in businesses and media industries.
