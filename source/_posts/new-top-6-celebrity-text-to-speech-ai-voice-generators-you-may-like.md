Keep in mind that by using these steps, you need to memorize the sentences and understand the beat of the chosen songs.

## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

![Set a timer to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-8.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Start the recording

 Then click “Start recording” to record the video with the timer on.

## Want to Clone Voices in Real-Time? Explore These GitHub Repositories

The advancements in AI technology have gone beyond our imagination. The AI can generate realistic images and read text aloud with the TTS tool. Also, real-time voice cloning technology has made a significant impact in today's world. You can transform plain text into lifelike AI-generated speech in various languages. It perfectly mimics the voice of another person and can read the text with accuracy.

Moreover, it uses neural networks and speech synthesis that can assist in complex domains. In this article, we'll explore some repositories of **real-time voice cloning GitHub**.

## Part 1: An Introduction to Real-Time Voice Cloning

Real-time voice cloning uses generative models to create real human voices. The building blocks are speech synthesis, voice embedding, and waveform generation. Also, the AI is trained to gather data on a set of human voice samples to generate authentic results. It gathers and learns how we talk - our pitch, rhythm, and voice quirks.

This voice cloning technology works on four models that enable real-time voice cloning. These models are text-to-Mel coder, speaker encoder, synthesizer, and vocoder. Real**\-time voice cloning software** has been integrated into various tools and platforms.
