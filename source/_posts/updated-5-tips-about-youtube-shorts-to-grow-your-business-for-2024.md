## Live Commerce Success Stories: Lessons Learned & Predictions for the Future

 The world of e-commerce has gone through a tremendous transformation in the recent past, with terms like **live commerce** , live streaming, live shopping, and live chat becoming a norm. S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

## Demystifying AI Game Generators | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. Explanation of what AI game generators are

An AI game generator is a cutting-edge software or system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automate and enhance various aspects of game development. It harnesses the power of machine learning, neural networks, and other AI methodologies to create, design, or assist in the creation of video games. Unlike traditional game development methods that heavily rely on manual design and coding, AI game generators offer a more automated and efficient approach.

## Part 2\. How do AI game generators differ from traditional game development methods?

AI game generators differ significantly from traditional game development methods in several key ways

### 1\. Automation and Efficiency

AI game generators automate various aspects of game development, such as content creation and level design, reducing the need for manual work.  
Traditional methods involve manual coding and design, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

### 2\. Speed of Development

AI game generators can rapidly generate game content and prototypes, speeding up development.  
Traditional methods may require extensive coding, design, and testing, leading to longer development cycles.

### 3\. Creativity and Innovation

AI game generators can introduce novel and unexpected elements by analyzing existing game data and patterns.  
Traditional methods use human creativity to design characters, levels, and gameplay mechanics.

### 4\. Personalization and Dynamic Content

AI game generators enable dynamic and personalized experiences by generating content based on player interactions.  
Traditional methods provide static content that's designed and coded beforehand.

### 5\. Resource Constraints

AI game generators can help smaller teams or indie developers overcome resource limitations by automating various tasks.  
Traditional methods require a larger team and more resources to create content and code from scratch.

### 6\. Iteration and Prototyping

AI game generators allow for rapid iteration and prototyping, enabling developers to test and refine ideas quickly.  
Traditional methods involve manual iteration and can be slower adapting to changes.

### 7\. Diverse Content Creation

AI game generators can produce various content variations, enhancing replayability and game diversity.  
Due to time and resource constraints, traditional methods may result in limited content.

### 8\. Human Expertise

AI game generators complement human expertise by automating routine tasks, freeing developers to focus on creative and strategic decisions.  
Traditional methods require developers to design, code, and implement every game element manually.

### 9\. Learning and Adaptation

AI game generators can learn from player behavior and adapt gameplay elements accordingly.  
Traditional methods rely on developers manually adjusting game elements based on feedback.

While AI game generators offer numerous advantages regarding efficiency, speed, and innovation, it's important to recognize that they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. They excel in automating certain tasks and enhancing creativity, but they are most effective when used with human expertise to create well-balanced and engaging gaming experiences.
