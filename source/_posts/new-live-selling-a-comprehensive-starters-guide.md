As**live selling** has a core element of being in real time, people can question and know about the product. Compared with traditional shopping, one can place an order through links mentioned in the livestream.

#### 2\. Reduced Return Rates and Customer Satisfaction

 Before live selling, people need to search for what they want by visiting the official sites of brands. Also, they scroll to read honest product reviews for the validity of products.

## What Is an AI Art Generator? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. What is an AI art generator?

An AI art generator is a software or system that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to create or assist in creating art. It uses machine learning algorithms, and intense learning models, to analyze and understand various artistic styles, designs, and patterns. By training on large datasets of existing artwork, an AI art generator learns to generate new, original artwork that imitates or extends upon the available styles.

AI art generators can produce various art forms, including paintings, drawings, digital art, and multimedia installations. They can generate artwork from scratch or assist artists by providing suggestions, enhancing creative workflows, and exploring new possibilities. AI art generators can also be used as tools for artistic exploration, enabling artists to experiment with different styles, combinations, and variations.

The generated art results from a collaboration between the AI system and the artist or user. The AI provides suggestions and inspirations or even autonomously creates art pieces based on given parameters or prompts. The artist or user can refine, modify, or incorporate the generated artwork into their creative process.

AI art generators have sparked new debates and discussions around the definition of art, creativity, and the role of machines in artistic expression. They are a fascinating example of how artificial intelligence can be applied in artistic creation, pushing the boundaries of traditional artistic practices and opening up new avenues for creative exploration and innovation.

## Part 2\. What are the applications and development directions for AI art generators?

The usage types of AI art generators encompass a wide range of creative applications and possibilities. Some of the notable usage types include:
