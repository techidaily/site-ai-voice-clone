An AI video generator is a software or system that automatically generates videos using artificial intelligence techniques, particularly deep learning and computer vision algorithms. It can analyze and interpret input data, such as images, text, or audio, and generate corresponding video content based on a large dataset's learned patterns and styles.

AI video generators can create videos from scratch or enhance existing videos by adding visual effects, altering scenes, or synthesizing new content. They can also assist in automating the video production process, including tasks like video editing, scene transitions, and object tracking.
