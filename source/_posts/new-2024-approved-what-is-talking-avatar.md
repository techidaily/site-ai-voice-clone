Major tech companies and AI platforms offer AI APIs, allowing developers to tap into powerful AI services and integrate them seamlessly into their projects.

## **Part 2\. How can AI revolutionize the API?**

Introducing AI can bring several changes and enhancements to APIs, revolutionizing the way applications interact with users and handle complex data.
