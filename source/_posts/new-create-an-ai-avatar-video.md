 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

## Part 4\. Discussion: Why Should We Shift To Live Selling?

 Live chatting services add more energy to your live events. As discussed, the**WooCommerce online chat** feature is essential to engage with potential customers. Some people still feel doubtful about whether they will get benefits or not. This section clarifies some potential benefits of shifting to live selling that users can get in the overall market:

1. **Build Connections:** Live streams add a human touch in the live selling that connects viewers emotionally. So you can easily build relationships to increase your brand awareness.
2. **Successful Selling:** People can understand what to expect from a product during the live stream. So, it results in successful live selling and reduced delivery returns.
3. **Global Audience:** Unlike traditional selling strategies, live selling helps reach international audiences. You can showcase products or services from anywhere to gain worldwide customers.
4. **Digital Experience:** Live selling is far ahead of the offline world. For this digital experience, shoppers don’t need to find reliable physical stores. Also, the digitalized live shopping experience is more entertaining and profitable.
