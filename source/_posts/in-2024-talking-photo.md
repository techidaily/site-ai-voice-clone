 Although Microsoft does not need an introduction, its services or products do. The full functionality of Office 365 is described in this video. We are aware that the simplicity of this video animation is precisely what we like about it. The explainer film made by the Microsoft team is the ideal example of what one should include.

 With the help of amazing characters, this 30-second animation showcases Microsoft Whiteboard's advantages and shows how to use it. The reason In a Nutshell is at the top of our list of the best animated explainer films is because they consistently provide the most aesthetically attractive videos.

![best-explainer-video-examples-teamwork.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-teamwork.jpg)

 You know why this is one of the finest explanation videos we've ever seen? the animated explainer backdrop. There is no question about the quality of the animation, but pay attention to how the music precisely reflects the development of the narrative and gives it a new depth without interfering with the narration.

 Each year, businesses produce tens of thousands of explainer films, some of which are excellent and some of which are among the greatest ever made. Making Teamwork Click is just one of them.

 Ahrefs is a collection of SEO tools. In terms of managing SEO, the video demonstrates how to utilize and benefit from the tool. An adorable and enjoyable animation goes horizontally to the right as the pieces in the Ahrefs explanation video leap up and down on the screen. Cool cinematography with a horizontal pan to the right, cute effects, and smooth transitions. There is creative typography on it.

 Ahrefs has effectively disproven the notion that a company's brand is too corporate for animated explainer films. This animated software demo film demonstrates that combining stylish transitions with educational material is a pretty smart concept. We believe that this video's straightforwardness makes the use of animation ideal for the message it is trying to express.

### 4. [McDonald’s Going Tech](https://vimeo.com/363361640)

The basic backdrop and figures used here wonderfully complement the animation, which keeps your focus on the app.

 Since videos that make viewers feel something are quite popular, we had to include this one on our list. Videos that evoke emotion in the viewer tend to be very popular, which is why we had to have this video on our list.

We're certain that this is one of our greatest animated explainer films since it has a properly written narrative, a lively vocal, and eye-catching image.

 Your video marketing plan won't be the same after you comprehend the power of videos and can determine if a certain video is beneficial or not. Acknowledging your errors also helps.

 The key to**creating AI videos from text** is a good prompt. Unlike text-to-image generators, creating video prompts needs greater detail and clarity. With a good prompt, you can effectively guide the AI model in understanding the desired visual elements, narrative structure, and emotional context of the video.

 Here, we list a few tips to create good prompts for generating videos from text:

1. **Provide context**

 When crafting your AI video prompt, include specific information such as desired style, target audience, intended platform for posting (e.g., YouTube), and preferred tone (e.g., casual or formal). You can also indicate if you want high-definition video, like 4K videos.

1. **Be clear and specific**

 Although providing details is important, avoid unnecessary things that could confuse AI text-to-video generators. Keep your prompt clear and focused to ensure the AI understands your instructions accurately.

1. **Use descriptive language**

 Given that the AI will transform your text into videos, use descriptive language to depict characters, settings, actions, and objects vividly. This will help the AI create a more accurate representation of your vision.

1. **Incorporate keywords**

 Some AI video prompt platforms may support the use of tags or keywords to help generate video according to our intent. Use these keywords to influence the AI's output effectively.

1. **Structure the prompt effectively**

 Organize your prompt in a logical manner to ensure clarity and coherence. Start with an introductory sentence that summarizes the main idea or theme of the video. Then, break down the key elements or scenes you want to include.

 Moreover, pay attention to scene transitions. In case you need multiple scenes, make sure they transition smoothly to maintain a coherent flow when**generating videos from text** .
