## Part 4\. FAQs about Udemy Subtitle Translator

**1\. How do I add subtitles to the Udemy course?**

 You can create subtitles from scratch using a simple text editor like Notepad or TextEdit. You need to follow the .vtt format for subtitles, which involves specifying the timing and text of each subtitle line. This option requires more effort but gives you complete control over the accuracy and style of your subtitles. You can also use Wondershare Virbo, which can generate subtitles automatically when you use this tool to translate videos.

**2\. How to add auto translate on any video**

 Auto translation can be achieved by using various tools. One of the best tools for auto-translation is Wondershare’s Virbo. It allows you to add translated captions in various languages to any video of your choice. Upload your video, choose the translation option and then select "Translate" and choose the desired language. You can also edit the generated subtitles before exporting them.

**3\. Is there any AI tool for translation?**

 There are many AI tools for translation. Tools like Google Translate, DeepL, Virbo, and Veed IO help you translate videos, audio, or text to generate new media. The accuracy of these tools is high, which can help companies generate AI videos to further target the international market.

**4\. How to generate AI videos for educational content?**

 The first step is scripting, where you need to get the script ready for your educational video. Secondly, you need an AI-powered tool for generating the voice-over. You can use Virbo which will not only generate voice but video as well. Lastly, once you add the script, the software will create a video for you that you can test and then roll out in the digital world.

## Final Verdict

 Udemy is one of the largest e-learning platforms with hundreds of thousands of high-quality courses catering to audiences from all over the world. However, most courses will be in English since it is predominantly an English service.

 But use Udemy subtitle translation tools like the ones we have mentioned above. You can easily and effectively learn courses in your own language by translating the subtitles into your native tongue.
