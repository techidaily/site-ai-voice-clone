* **Fluency and Naturalness:** Viewers can lose interest in the video if it is not translated well. A good, translated video should smoothly play in a natural tone. In this regard, there should not be awkward and literal translations. Plus, the dialogue must seem originally written for the targeted audience.
* **Localization:** As discussed earlier, considering cultural sensitivity means complying with laws. Thus, content should suit the cultural norms and preferences of the viewers. For this purpose, a video must adapt with visuals, references, and chosen language.
* **Subtitle and Dubbing Quality:** No matter what format you are using, the translation must maintain quality. Well-translated video contains well-timed and easy-to-read subtitles. They are properly formatted in the video, while dubbing matches the lip movements.
* **Contextual Understanding:** The first thing you should consider in a video is that it conveys a proper message. The translated video must reflect a deeper understanding of source materials. Also, ensure that the character’s expression, cultural references, and jokes are improved.
* **Technical Quality:** Quality matters a lot, whether it's video quality or translation quality. A good, translated video contains sound quality, resolution, pitch, and speed. Overall, it must preserve all the production values of the video.
