 Subtitles are important for video content, as they enhance the overall experience. They act as a helping aid in multiple situations, environments, and more. This section of the reading elaborates on the advantages of subtitles below:

1. **Inclusivity and Accessibility:** Primarily, subtitles make content available to a broader audience. Whether anyone is facing a hearing loss or hearing impairment, they can still read. In scenes where non-native audiences cannot understand speech, they are a savior. In video lectures or tutorials, subtitles enhance the audience's comprehension.
2. **Multilingual Translation:** An increased understanding of disabled audiences’ aids in multilingual support. When you generate subtitles for a video, you can transform it into other languages. Later, you can use text-to-speech converters to generate multilingual speech.
