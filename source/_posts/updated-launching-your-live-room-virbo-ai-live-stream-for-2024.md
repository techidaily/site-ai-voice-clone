## Part 3: Considerations and Limitations of Real-Time Video Translation

 While the tools above offer exciting possibilities, it’s important to understand their limitations. Here are some considerations when choosing a real-time video translation app. This way, when you use these tools, you’ll know what to expect and what might have some challenges.

Accuracy

 Even the best human translators sometimes struggle with complex sentences, slang, or thick accents. Real-time translation of videos using AI is similar. While it’s constantly learning, it might misunderstand some things. So, keep things simple and clear in your videos, especially if your audience might need real-time translation.

Latency

 Imagine you’re having a conversation, but there’s a slight pause between your words and the other person’s response. It throws things off a bit, right? That’s kind of what latency is like in**real-time video translation** . There’s a short delay between what’s spoken and the translated text appearing. For critical conversations, consider using pre-recorded videos with translated subtitles or voiceovers.

Supported Languages

 Apps that translate videos in real-time are getting better at handling a wider range of languages, but some are more supported than others. Check the app you’re considering and the languages it supports. If your language isn’t on the list, you might need to look for alternative solutions.

![app supported languages illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/real-time-video-translation-10.jpg)

## Conclusion

**Real-time video translation** tools are breaking down language barriers faster. Imagine watching a foreign news report and understanding it instantly or conversing with someone who speaks another language live.

 The apps listed here are powerful, but choosing the right one depends on your needs. If you want to understand the content, real-time translation is perfect. But consider AI voice cloning if you need to create videos with a specific voice.

 For seamless real-time translation, check out Virbo. It’s a great option to help you bridge the language gap and connect with the world in a new way.

2. **Speech Recognition:** The AI system extracts the audio and converts it into text. In the case of only subtitle files, the systems will recognize the language of the uploaded SRT.
3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.

 Livestream shopping is a practice that involves product promotion through a live video. This innovative concept creates an engaging environment for shopping through live video entertainment. Unlike traditional e-commerce, livestream shopping encourages active audience participation. As a result, viewers can get real-time product demonstrations and responses from the hosts.

### 1\. Video Equipment

 You need a fine camera to ensure clear video for high-quality product display. Also, there should be a tripod stand to keep this camera stable and cover multiple angles. You may also use ring lights or LED panels, as good lighting is crucial for better visibility.

### 2\. Audio Equipment

 Make sure to use an external microphone, as a dedicated one ensures better audio quality. Also, a hands-free microphone makes operability easier for hosts moving around in the live stream.

### 3\. Live Streaming Setup

 You must have a computer to handle streaming software and many applications. Use any of the streaming software, but make sure to have a strong internet connection. You also need a platform that supports live-stream shopping, like Facebook or TikTok.

This trend came to the attention of millions of Chinese consumers. Also, it appeared to be a convenient way, as everyone got smartphones and payment cards for easy procession.

 Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic proved to favor this shopping trend. This was because the physical market was almost shut down completely. Thus, China's live shopping took growth progress to approximately $352 billion by 2021\. Yet, there reached a point when it slowed down and devalued. Here are some of the critical reasons for the brief downfall of livestream shopping in China:

1. **Saturated Market:** The market became overcrowded with the gradual increase in livestream shopping. The increased competition among hosts led to its saturation and the pause in its growth.
2. **Consumer Fatigue:** Continuous exposure to livestream shopping events made consumers less enthusiastic. Also, regular promotional messages and a lack of variety made them lose interest.

They released an in-app shopping feature in the “[WeChat](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/china-tech-giant-tencent-launches-new-online-shopping-feature-in-wechat-app.html) ” messaging service. It led to a gross profit of almost $14 billion in the overall valuation. Moreover, several tools are now working in favor of livestream shopping, increasing users' diversity.
