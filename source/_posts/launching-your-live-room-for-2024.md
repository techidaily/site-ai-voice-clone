## What Is AI Voice Text to Speech? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1: What is AI Text to Speech?

AI text to speech (TTS) is the cutting-edge technology that utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to convert written text into natural-sounding spoken language. By analyzing the textual input, AI TTS systems generate audio output that simulates human speech, incorporating elements such as intonation, rhythm, and emphasis. This advanced technology enables computers and devices to communicate with users using lifelike and expressive voices.

## Part 2: What Can AI Voice Text to Speech Be Used For?

AI voice text to speech has numerous applications across various domains:

**Accessibility:** AI text to voice technology empowers individuals with visual impairments or reading difficulties to access written content by converting it into spoken language. It enhances accessibility by enabling users to listen to digital books, articles, and other textual materials.

**Language Learning:** AI TTS tools aid language learners in improving pronunciation and comprehension. Learners can listen to correct pronunciation models and practice speaking skills by converting written text into spoken language.

**Assistive Technologies:** Text to voice finds applications in assistive technologies such as screen readers, voice assistants, and navigation systems. These technologies assist users in interacting with devices, accessing information, and navigating digital interfaces using spoken language.
