Where production houses used to pay millions to voice actors, they can now use voice clones. This article will discuss the rise of voice cloning, its applications, and a relevant tool.

## Part 1: A Basic Definition of AI Voice Cloning

**AI voice cloning** refers to the techniques that enable users to generate deepfake voices from a sample.
