Users typically provide input to the AI headshot generator, such as specifying certain attributes or characteristics they want in the generated image, like age, gender, ethnicity, facial expression, and more. The AI then processes this input and generates a corresponding headshot that matches the desired criteria.

These generators can be used for various purposes, including creating profile pictures, avatars, character images for games or storytelling, and even for artistic or creative projects. It's worth noting that while these generators can produce impressive results, they might sometimes unintentionally perpetuate certain biases present in the training data, which is an important consideration when using such tools.

## Part 2\. Can AI-created headshots be used in professional occasion?
