3. Once you choose a voice, you can customize it. You can change its speed, pitch, volume, and pauses. You can adjust sliders to make the voice sound unique, or use special symbols and commands to control how it sounds.
4. You can listen to a preview of your voice creation on the website before you do anything else. If you like it, you can download it as an MP3 file to use in your projects. Whether you're using it for personal or business purposes, Virbo gives you full access to your voice creation.

### Key Features of Virbo

2. It supports many languages and accents, like English, Spanish, French, Chinese, and Japanese. You can easily switch between languages by typing the language code.
3. The app offers different types of voices for different purposes, like storytelling, teaching, podcasts, and games. Each voice category is made to fit a specific role.
4. It lets you add emotions to the voice. You can make it sound happy, sad, angry, calm, and more. By typing emotions in brackets, you can make the voice express different feelings.
