6. **Legal and Ethical Boundaries:**  Upholding legal and ethical boundaries is important in all documents. If the video contains any medical records, it is essential to keep them confidential. In case of sensitive information, a translator must follow legal and ethical considerations.
7. **Requirements and Review:**  To achieve perfection, try finding a native translator for proofreading. The translator should follow any specific instructions provided by the client.
