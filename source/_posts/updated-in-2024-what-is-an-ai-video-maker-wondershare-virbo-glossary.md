## What Is an AI Video Maker? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1.**What is an AI video maker?**

AI video maker refers to a video creation tool that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automate or enhance various aspects of the video production process. These tools often integrate machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to perform tasks such as video editing, scene recognition, automated video generation, voiceover synthesis, and more.

With AI video makers, users can create professional-looking videos more efficiently and with less manual effort. These tools can analyze raw video footage, apply filters, add visual effects, generate subtitles, and even suggest relevant music or soundtracks based on the video's content. Some AI video makers can also create videos from scratch using provided assets, such as images and text, transforming them into dynamic and engaging visual presentations.

The use of AI in video creation has significantly simplified the process and made it accessible to individuals and businesses without specialized video editing skills. As AI technology advances, AI video makers will likely become even more sophisticated, allowing for more creative and innovative video productions.

## Part 2\. Any differences between an AI video maker and a generator?

Yes, there is a difference between an AI video maker and an AI video generator, although they are related concepts.

### 1\. AI Video Maker

It provides users various automated features and tools to streamline video production. AI video makers typically offer functionalities such as automatic video editing, scene recognition, visual effects, subtitle generation, voiceover synthesis, and music suggestions.
