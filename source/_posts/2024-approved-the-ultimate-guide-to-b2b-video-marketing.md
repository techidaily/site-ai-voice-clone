## Part 2: Why is B2B Video Marketing Important?

**B2B video marketing** is essential to reach your targeted businesses easily. This section will highlight the significance of B2B video marketing in a brief manner.

### 1\. Visually Appealing and Engaging

**B2B YouTube** videos are naturally appealing due to their captivating visuals. That’s why B2B video marketing can effectively catch the attention of your targeted audience. You can add animation and use Avatars to add distinctiveness to your video. Moreover, you can embed your**B2B video** with an engaging audio track to make your audience attentive.

### 3\. Offers Expertise and Clear Demonstration

 To sell your business product, you should demonstrate its key advantages. You can give your expertise through B2B videos with visual representation. Moreover, you can give your audience a proper demonstration to use your product without difficulty. Your viewers would also be able to absorb the guidelines through a video rather than reading a descriptive text.

### 4\. Free Advertisement

 Do you want to promote your brand name and product? B2B videos work as free advertisements as they have a high chance of going viral on social media platforms. You may have encountered**B2B** **YouTube** videos in which you can see the key selling points of a particular product or service.

## Live Selling: A Comprehensive Starter's Guide

 The spread of the internet has changed consumer purchasing habits in recent years. Now, social media platforms are the growing digital marketplaces for products. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend of online shopping, and people now prefer buying online. This digital shopping mode eliminates the struggle to leave physical spaces in their busy routines.

![live selling and how to perform](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-live-selling-in-todays-work-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. A Basic Preview To "Live Shopping"

**Livestream selling** or live shopping refers to live product demonstrations on digital platforms. The retailer or host has to introduce themselves, their store, and sale before describing products. They explain each detail of the products and their prices while holding them in a direct video call. During that, ensure that followers can see the product and interact through comments.

 Customers perceive it as a lively shopping experience instead of websites loading products. It creates a sense of connection as people feel like shopping in physical stores. As**live selling** has a core element of being in real time, people can question and know about the product. Compared with traditional shopping, one can place an order through links mentioned in the livestream.

 Live selling is an emerging way to attract customers to shop on online marketplaces.

#### 2\. Reduced Return Rates and Customer Satisfaction

 Before live selling, people need to search for what they want by visiting the official sites of brands. Also, they scroll to read honest product reviews for the validity of products.
