S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market.

In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

## How To Perform a Successful Streaming on Twitch

 Live streaming has become a regular source of enjoyment for many people in recent years, especially on a platform like Twitch. In the first quarter of 2023 alone, Twitch users watched[over 5.3 billion hours](https://backlinko.com/twitch-users) of video.

 If you’re a content creator, you should definitely consider leveraging this power of Twitch video streaming, as it tends to have higher levels of engagement compared to pre-recorded content. But with so many Twitch streamers out there, standing out from the crowd can be challenging.

 If you’re new to the scene, we can help you start your Twitch streaming journey off right with the right gear and some useful tips.

![Live stream on Twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Essential Preparations Before Beginning Your Twitch Streaming Journey

 Whether you're playing games, hosting events, or just chatting, streaming on Twitch is an exciting and rewarding way to engage with your audience in real-time. But to do well on Twitch, you need to prepare properly so your viewers can enjoy watching your content.

To start streaming on Twitch, here's what you'll need:

### Twitch Streaming Software

 First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.

1. **OBS Studio**

 OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.

1. **Twitch Studio**

 Twitch Studio is the official free streaming application developed to simplify the streaming process for new streamers on Twitch. It offers an intuitive interface and pre-made scenes designed to streamline the user experience.

### Streaming equipment

1. **A device to stream from**

 To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you'll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.

 If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:

* **CPU**

 When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.

* **GPU or graphic cards**

 Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU's workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.

1. **Microphone**

 Although you might get by using a gaming headset's built-in microphone for a bit, it's better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.

1. **Webcam**

 If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.

 You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.

![Equipment for Twitch video streaming](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-2.jpg)

### Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules

AI videos leverage the power of artificial intelligence to streamline video production processes, improve visual storytelling, and push the boundaries of creative expression in video content.

## Part 2\. What technologies are commonly used in AI videos?

In the definition above of AI videos, various use cases can be observed, which also require the following potential technological means:

### 1\. Computer vision

In videos, computer vision techniques can be used for object detection, tracking, and segmentation to identify and extract specific objects or regions.

### 2\. Image Synthesis

Image synthesis techniques leverage AI algorithms to generate realistic visual effects, allowing virtual objects or effects to integrate into videos and create imaginative scenes.

### 3\. Video super-resolution

AI video technology can use deep learning algorithms to upscale low-resolution video images, enhancing the clarity and details of the video.

### 4\. Video restoration

By employing AI algorithms, videos can be automatically restored by addressing issues such as noise, artifacts, and blurriness, restoring the quality and visual appeal of the video.

### 5\. Video editing and clipping

AI technology can automate video editing and clipping tasks, including scene recognition, shot transitions, and audio processing, improving the efficiency and quality of video production.

### 6\. Video generation

AI generative models can automatically create new video content, such as generating scenes based on textual descriptions or creating visual effects based on music, providing new possibilities for creativity.

### 7\. Face recognition and expression analysis

AI video technology can identify faces in videos and analyze facial expressions and emotions, enabling applications such as human-computer interaction, emotion analysis, and personalized recommendations.

These technologies enhance video production efficiency, elevate visual effects, and enable the creation of compelling and innovative AI video content.
