### 2\. AI Video Generator

On the other hand, an AI video generator is an AI system that can autonomously produce videos from scratch without human intervention. These generators use AI algorithms, often powered by deep learning techniques, to create videos based on specific input parameters or data. For example, an AI video generator could take images, text, or audio inputs and use them to generate a complete video sequence. The generated videos may be entirely fictional or based on real-world data, depending on the system's design and purpose.

In summary, the main difference lies in their primary functions: an AI video maker assists users in the video creation process. In contrast, an AI video generator autonomously produces videos without human intervention. Both concepts leverage AI technology to enhance video-related tasks, but they serve different purposes and cater to other use cases. challenges they may present.
