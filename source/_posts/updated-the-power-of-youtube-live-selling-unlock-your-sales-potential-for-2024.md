## Part 1\. Some Rules and Requirements To Understand Before Live Streaming on Instagram

 Like every platform, Instagram has some protocols for broadcasting content to global audiences. Therefore, learning the rules and requirements before going live on Instagram is necessary. First, your account should be at least 30 days old; otherwise, they can restrict your stream.

 There is a rule that you can go live for 4 hours per stream without retakes. This length was increased from 60 minutes in the recent update. Also, you can repost a live video on your profile if it is more than 15 minutes long. Instagram allows you to schedule a stream from 1 hour to 90 days in advance.

 The initial requirement of**Instagram Live RTMP** is that your content be respectful and updated. Additionally, you need to set your stream to 1920x1080 resolution on a vertical camera. Meanwhile, Instagram gives leverage on the number of followers so that you can start with minimum viewers. Also, there is no need to have a business account for live streaming.

## Part 2\. How To Live Stream to Instagram With an RTMP?

 Setting high-quality live streams encourages people to tune into your broadcast. For this purpose, you need a seamless encoder like[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) . Unfortunately, Instagram doesn't officially support third-party encoders. To solve this query, you need an effective solution.

 Therefore, the following steps guide streaming on Instagram with an RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol). You will also learn how to set the required parameters in this comprehensive guide:

* **Step 1.** Start with downloading and launching OBS Studio on your PC. The first thing to do is set up vertical camera dimensions for**RTMP Instagram live** streaming. To access the settings window, hit the “Settings” option in the “Controls” panel.

## Part 2: Why are Subtitles Important in Video Content?

 Subtitles are important for video content, as they enhance the overall experience. They act as a helping aid in multiple situations, environments, and more. This section of the reading elaborates on the advantages of subtitles below:

1. **Inclusivity and Accessibility:** Primarily, subtitles make content available to a broader audience. Whether anyone is facing a hearing loss or hearing impairment, they can still read. In scenes where non-native audiences cannot understand speech, they are a savior. In video lectures or tutorials, subtitles enhance the audience's comprehension.
2. **Multilingual Translation:** An increased understanding of disabled audiences’ aids in multilingual support. When you generate subtitles for a video, you can transform it into other languages. Later, you can use text-to-speech converters to generate multilingual speech.
3. **Improved SEO Performance:** You must have been aware of SEO and its ranking policies. Subtitles double your video’s SEO ranking and overall performance. Hence, adding subtitles can help the audience find your video on top search results. This is a valuable marketing tactic for content creators and brands working online.
4. **Noise-Sensitive Environments:** As lives become demanding, the time of leisure limits every day. Students and professionals entertain themselves during their travel time. However, these environments, like traffic, libraries, and offices, are noise-sensitive. This is where subtitles help with content comprehension when you cannot hear.
5. **Improved Learning:** People try to learn multiple languages via video content. Subtitles help them with better comprehension by engaging both audio and visual senses. The audience also has a visual representation of spoken language for quick learning. They also clarify any misunderstandings of dialogues and maintain consistency.
6. **Legal Requirements:** In some regions, adding subtitles is a legal requirement. For instance, communist nations make them compulsory for their disabled audience. Thus, instead of hiring editors or translators, video speech-to-text converters online are preferable.

## Part 3: How Well Has AI Adapted to Converting Video Content into Text?

 In the past, the procedure to**translate video audio to text**  was quite complex. It changed with the advancement of automatic speech recognition and natural language processing.
