1. **Free of copyright infringement**

 It's essential to use images that are free from any copyright restrictions or infringement. Only use anime character photos that you have the legal right to use, whether they are from your personal collection or obtained from royalty-free sources.

 Images with proper lighting and high resolution are essential for achieving crisp and detailed animations. Avoid images that are overly dark, blurry, or pixelated, as they may result in less visually appealing animations.

1. **Facing forward with a clear and visible face**

 Select images where the anime character is facing forward and their face is clearly visible. This allows for precise facial animation, including lip-syncing and expression changes, which are key elements in creating realistic talking animations.
