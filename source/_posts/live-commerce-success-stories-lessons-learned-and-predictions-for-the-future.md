## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.

4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

The translation should be natural while avoiding any awkward encounters. Moreover, the tone and writing style should be consistent throughout the document.
2. **Cultural Boundaries:**  The tone or words must not violate cultural norms and ethics. Some cultures are sensitive to specific content, while to some, it is no big deal. Hence, the translator should have background information on target cultures.
3. **Relevant Jargon and Expressions:**  Vast training data helps comprehend the content better. This involves the use of industry-specific jargon and terminologies. In addition, idiomatic expressions also elevate content and attract target audience.
4. **Proofread and Finalized:**  It can bring clarity through well-structured and well-managed sentences. Another way of maintaining clarity is by correcting grammatical and spelling errors. The translated content must be proofread and well-formatted to rule out any mistakes. Using headings, sub-headings, bullet points, and formatting elements does the trick.
5. **Uphold Local Standards:**  To relate with the audience, adopting the local language is important. The translator must gather some insights into regional or cultural norms. This will help in the translation of content in an effective and preferred way.
6. **Legal and Ethical Boundaries:**  Upholding legal and ethical boundaries is important in all documents. If the video contains any medical records, it is essential to keep them confidential. In case of sensitive information, a translator must follow legal and ethical considerations.
7. **Requirements and Review:**  To achieve perfection, try finding a native translator for proofreading. The translator should follow any specific instructions provided by the client.

### 6\. Noise Recognition and Advancements
