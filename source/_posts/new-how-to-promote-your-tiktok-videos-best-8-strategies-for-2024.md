 The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

 Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.
