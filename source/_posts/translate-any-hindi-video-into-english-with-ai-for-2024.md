[FreeInterTV](http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2565) is an all-in-one package that also displays MSNBC news online. It is a great platform and a free alternative to the original website. However, the magic of this platform is that it provides you with most TV channels from all across the world.

 The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

 Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.

 Ever tried those fun Snapchat lenses? The**talking emoji on Apple** devices works in a similar fashion to Snapchat lenses. But instead of relying on custom masks from Snapchat, it uses popular emojis.

 Animoji takes advantage of the TrueDepth camera system and the iPhone's internal chip to use Face ID technology. Apple first introduced Face ID in 2017 with the iPhone X. Now, all newer iPhone models come equipped with Face ID.

 So you can use and make Animoji on iPhone X or later. You can also use it on the iPad Pro 11-inch or the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) and newer models.
