 Once it’s available to use for the public, you can use Sora on their[official website](https://openai.com/sora) . Follow these steps on**how to use OpenAI’s Sora video generator** :

* **Step 1:** Write the prompt

 You will need to start providing a detailed written prompt outlining the content you wish to see in your video. This prompt could include descriptions of scenes or any specific visual elements you envision.

* **Step 2:** Generate the AI video (max. 1 minute)

 After submitting your written prompt, Sora's AI model will analyze and interpret your text, generating a video that encapsulates the essence of your prompt. The resulting video will last no longer than one minute.

* **Step 3:** How to create longer videos

 For those who want to produce longer videos, you may need to add additional details or scenes and synchronize them with the desired frame count to create a cohesive narrative.

![Generate videos from text with OpenAI Sora.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/how-to-generate-videos-from-text-1.gif)

## Part 2\. Sora Alternative: How To Create Video From Text

 If you're seeking an alternative to Sora for**creating videos from text** , you can try using invideo.io. Invideo.io presents itself as an effective text-to-video generator tool designed to transform textual content effortlessly into video.

InVideo.io features:

* Accessibility through mobile apps for convenient video creation on the go

* **Step 2:** Input the text prompt.

 Once you are on the interface, you can input your prompt. Give clear and detailed instructions for optimal results, and click the "Generate a video" button to proceed.

 _A realistic video showcasing the evolution of urban landscapes from the 20th century to the present day, highlighting architectural styles, infrastructure advancements, and societal changes. Incorporate visuals of iconic buildings, city skylines, transportation systems, and cultural landmarks to illustrate the transformation over time._

## Part 3\. Tips for Writing Prompts To Generate Videos From Text

 The key to**creating AI videos from text** is a good prompt. Unlike text-to-image generators, creating video prompts needs greater detail and clarity. With a good prompt, you can effectively guide the AI model in understanding the desired visual elements, narrative structure, and emotional context of the video.

 Here, we list a few tips to create good prompts for generating videos from text:

1. **Provide context**

 When crafting your AI video prompt, include specific information such as desired style, target audience, intended platform for posting (e.g., YouTube), and preferred tone (e.g., casual or formal). You can also indicate if you want high-definition video, like 4K videos.

1. **Be clear and specific**

 Although providing details is important, avoid unnecessary things that could confuse AI text-to-video generators. Keep your prompt clear and focused to ensure the AI understands your instructions accurately.

1. **Use descriptive language**

 Given that the AI will transform your text into videos, use descriptive language to depict characters, settings, actions, and objects vividly. This will help the AI create a more accurate representation of your vision.

1. **Incorporate keywords**

 Some AI video prompt platforms may support the use of tags or keywords to help generate video according to our intent. Use these keywords to influence the AI's output effectively.

1. **Structure the prompt effectively**

 Organize your prompt in a logical manner to ensure clarity and coherence. Start with an introductory sentence that summarizes the main idea or theme of the video. Then, break down the key elements or scenes you want to include.

 Moreover, pay attention to scene transitions. In case you need multiple scenes, make sure they transition smoothly to maintain a coherent flow when**generating videos from text** .

## Translate Video From Japanese to English Online for Free

 Let’s say you’re a business owner or a content creator in Japan. If you want to broaden your horizons, you may need to**translate videos from Japanese to English** . This is because English is spoken globally. You can sell more, share knowledge, and connect with English speakers worldwide.

 For streaming platforms, turning Japanese content into English is a ticket to reaching audiences all over the globe. And businesses using Japanese tech might need translated training videos for their remote workers.

 Seeing this growing need, it’s clear you need effective video translation solutions. So, we’ve created a guide to help you choose the best method for each step, including using AI. Finding the right way to translate videos is important, so keep reading!

![listening to a video while writing](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-video-japanese-to-english-01.jpg)

## Part I. Completed Process To Translate Videos From Japanese to English

 When you want to**translate a video from Japanese to English** , you can follow some general steps, no matter how you decide to do it. Let’s break down each step for you:

* **Step 1:** Video Transcription

 Before you can translate, you need to understand what’s being said. So, the initial step is to do a video transcription. You can either hire professionals or use a Japanese-to-English video translator app to convert the spoken language to text.

 Transcription captures all the Japanese dialogue, ensuring the English translation is spot-on. Having the text file lets you edit it, like shortening sentences or adjusting cultural references. This results in a smoother and more natural English video for you.

* **Step 2:** Translation

 Once you have the transcript, you can translate the Japanese text into English. A good translation ensures the original message is accurately conveyed in the new language. It avoids any misunderstandings or misinterpretations for your English viewers. You have two options to do it. Both have strengths and weaknesses, so let’s see which suits your needs best.

* **Professional Human Translation Services**

 When you want to translate a video from Japanese to English, a pro can make the sentences sound right for your audience. These professionals tweak the tone to be natural and engaging. If you go to translation agencies, they make sure the work is top-notch by going through strict editing and reviewing. However, human translation services cost more and take a bit more time than machine translation tools.

* **Machine Translation Tools**

 Machine translation tools are fast and affordable. They can be a good option for short, simple videos where perfect accuracy isn’t critical. But it often struggles with complex language, cultural references, and humor.

* **Step 3:** Timing and Implementation

 Let’s talk about making the Japanese to English video translation seamless. After translating, you want the words to match the original rhythm and pace of the speaker in the video. It keeps things feeling natural and engaging for you, the viewer. Plus, speakers use non-verbal cues like jokes, emotions, and pauses. Matching the translated text with these visual cues keeps the video’s meaning and impact intact.

 How to do it? Professional workflows often use timecode, which gives each video frame a unique timestamp. It ensures super precise subtitle placement for that perfect synchronization. Some video editing tools even have “waveforms” to help visually line up subtitles with the spoken parts.

![editing a video using a software](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-video-japanese-to-english-02.jpg)

 Here are several ways to add the translated Japanese text to your video:

* **Subtitles**

 Subtitles are like on-screen translators for you. They show the English dialogue while the original Japanese audio goes on. It helps you understand if you get the visuals but not the language. The focus is on getting the main point across and sometimes making the sentences shorter for easier reading.

* **Closed Captions**

 Like subtitles, closed captions (CC) are words shown on the screen. They go beyond spoken words, covering all the sounds you hear, like dialogue, music, and even background noises. The main goal is to help you, especially if you’re deaf or struggle with hearing. So, if you’re aiming for videos everyone can enjoy, try a video translator from Japanese to English with CC capabilities.

* **Dubbing**

 Dubbing is a more intricate process where the original Japanese audio track is completely replaced. Voice actors step in to record the translated script in English. They try to sync up their words with the lip movements of the characters on screen. It makes it seem like the characters speak English right from the start, giving you a more immersive viewing experience.

* **Voiceover**

 In this method, a narrator reads the translated script in English over the original Japanese audio. It’s often used in documentaries or educational videos when you need more info beyond just the dialogue.

* **Step 4:** Final Review and Approval

 Alright, so you’re at the last step now. You’re giving the translated video a good check to ensure everything’s spot-on – accurate, consistent, and top-notch quality. It means looking out for any problems in the translation, timing, or how you choose to do it. Once you give the thumbs up to the final version, you’ve got a smooth and effective English video ready for your audience.

 You might find the previous steps tedious and time-consuming. But what if you could translate your video from Japanese to English in minutes? That way, you could reach new markets and expand your influence faster. AI video translators like[Wondershare Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/) can help you spread your work, passions, and stories to a global audience. Read on to learn more.

## Part IV. How To Achieve the Best Video Translation Results?

 You can’t always**translate a video from Japanese to English** without a few difficulties. Here are some ways to make the process easier for you:

Divide the Script Into Manageable Chunks

 Break down the script into smaller sections like sentences, phrases, or even shorter segments depending on the video’s pace and complexity. It allows for more precise timing adjustments later.

Use a “Shadowing” Technique

 As you watch the video, read the translated text out loud. Adjust the subtitle timing to match how you naturally speak. Doing this makes the flow feel more natural for you and the viewers.

Test and Refine

 Now that you’ve set the timing for the subtitles, it’s time to put them to the test with your target audience. This step is important because it helps you catch any timing problems, awkward phrasing, or cultural differences that might have slipped through during editing.

 Listen to what your audience says, and then use that feedback to tweak the subtitles. Your goal is to make sure they’re clear, short, and match the audience’s culture.

AI for Pre-Translation Tasks

 Take advantage of AI tools for speech-to-text conversion and automatic subtitle generation. It can save time, but always proofread for accuracy and natural flow.

File Compatibility

 Ensure your chosen translation service or tool supports the format of your video file. The common formats include MP4, MOV, and AVI.

![video file format illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-video-japanese-to-english-08.jpg)

 Although the AI tools mentioned above can help you generate YouTube Shorts according to your need, they cannot entirely replace human creativity. Are you looking to improve the quality of your YouTube Shorts? Here are a few tips that may come in handy in making your videos more entertaining.

### 1\. Keep it Short

 Remember, these short videos on YouTube are called “YouTube Shorts” for a reason. It is important to keep your content minimal and to the point. Your key focus should be on content delivery and making your videos as concise as possible.

 Moreover, you should value your viewer’s time as well. Studies also suggest that the attention span of users is gradually decreasing. So it is a good practice to determine the length of the video beforehand.

### 2\. Customize Thumbnails

 Thumbnails play an important role in the engagement of your video. It is how viewers decide if they want to click on your video or not. It is advisable to create custom thumbnails for your YouTube Shorts. Design a thumbnail that complements your content. Incorporate catchy and attention-grabbing elements to increase views.

### 3\. Consistency is Key

 It is important to remain consistent across your Shorts videos. Maintaining a consistent style and tone is a key element. It helps build a recognizable brand identity. Making a regular posting schedule is also a key factor on the YouTube platform. Sticking to a routine is always helpful whether you choose to upload weekly, bi-weekly, or another interval.

### 4\. Dynamic and Appealing Aesthetics

 Focusing on the visuals of your Shorts can enhance viewer engagement and make your content stand out. Aesthetically pleasing visuals capture viewers' attention. Dynamic aesthetics maintain their interest throughout the video. Unique and engaging elements also make your videos more memorable.
