## How to Make an Animated Explainer Video

 Explainer films are among the easiest and most inventive methods to present a project, a product, a service, or pretty much anything else you can imagine. In reality, the demand for an explanation film increases with product complexity. Fortunately, with the help of some of the fantastic explainer video software tools available online, you may be able to accomplish it yourself.

![animated-explainer-video.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-video.jpg)

 You'll find a few tools in this article that will let you sit down and make whatever kind of explainer film you want. An overview of the key components required for a successful explainer video is provided at the bottom.

## **Part 1: The Preparation Stage of Animated Explainers**

 An explainer video's primary goal is to improve the company's marketing plan. They are so distinctive and ultimately successful because of this. However, for the creation process to be successful, it must also include all participants and be open and transparent. The process may sometimes be full of intriguing and surprising answers at any point, or it might reach a dead end. Actually, the whole creative process is quite orderly and transparent. Here is a list of the actions you need to do to complete it successfully.

### **Define Your Target Audience and Purpose:**

 The process often begins with project research, which includes gathering data from the customer, doing a market study, and completing product research.

 The key is clarity since it will enable you to precisely explain your requirements for team members and resources. Your explainer video's success depends on careful preparation. You must work together without hurrying or falling behind since there will be several connected jobs.

### **Craft a Compelling Script:**

 The screenplay describes all the video's spoken words, whether you're using voiceovers, dialogue, or a mix of the two. During the pre-production phase, we devote a significant amount of time and effort to scriptwriting.

 Consequently, the next and most crucial phase in the creation of animated videos is scriptwriting. It determines if a marketing message will be conveyed to the target audience clearly and, more broadly, whether the video will convert.

### **Select the Right Animation Style and Tools:**

 After the script has been polished and completed, style and formatting are needed. This phase also aids in giving you a general idea of the character that will appear in the video, the color schemes that will be used, the tone, etc. Start by gathering supporting materials for the final film, such as images, videos, and other elements. Referencing your storyboard and keeping a list of the materials your video needs is a smart idea. Animated characters, icons, and images are examples of assets.

 Make the spectator feel as if they are a part of the universe you have created. This is a challenging step since you must coordinate all the animations to get the ideal outcome! Along with speech and other significant notes, they often contain instructions for camera angles, tips and changes for lighting, and transitions between scenes.

### **Choose an Appropriate Voice-Over or Narration:**

 Like the majority of experienced writers, brilliant marketers start their videos with voice-over narrations. It's crucial to remember that before the animation process can begin, the voice-over must be recorded.

 The majority of video editing programs provide you access to stock music that you may use in your productions. As an alternative, you may search through a variety of websites with royalty-free music to locate the ideal song for your film.

## **Part 2: The Operation Procedure to Create Animated Explainer Videos**

 Some people may believe that making animated explanation films is simple. The misunderstanding is mostly caused by how brief and uncomplicated many animated videos on social media are. From consulting with customers, selecting ideas, and developing a storyboard to accomplishing business objectives, video production is complicated.

### **Design Captivating Characters or Visual Elements** **:**

 For many years, the customer journey has been heavily influenced by brand identification and brand trust. Finding a simple technique to easily convey your brand to a target demographic is the difficult part. Animated explainer videos excel in this situation. A useful tool for promoting goods, services, concepts, and companies is an animated explainer film. Explainer videos are an innovative marketing strategy that many forward-thinking companies actively include into their operations.

 There are several techniques to animate your films since there is no one approach that works perfectly. Be original and imaginative. You could be unsure about what style to utilize as a result. You should create many instances of the same character because of this. It aids in better appreciating the mood of the video. In this manner, you can choose which fashions suit your brand and the tone of the film the most!

### **Animate the Scenes Using Motion Graphics or Traditional Animation Techniques:**

 The second piece of advice is to make sure your animated film appears just as stunning without sound as it does with it. An animated figure often follows a script in an explainer film, utilizing objects and other visual elements to guide viewers through a process or explain a topic. When developing mascots for a family-oriented product offering, live-action videos may have a significant influence.

 The most enjoyable part is undoubtedly the illustrations! You get to choose and create your characters' environments. Users will be interested and more inclined to watch the video due to the animation. Because of this, it's preferable to employ titers in the film or make your animation seem catchy from the very beginning.

### **Incorporate Suitable Background Music and Sound Effects:**

 The audience won't be interested in the product if the voice-over isn't up to par. If they can't even hear what you have to say due to voice quality issues, how can they be interested? It's time to concentrate on the sound now. It is where you put together the narration, music, and sound effects to provide the audience the best experience possible.

 If you're just starting off, this step could seem a little intimidating. Consider employing a professional with built-in tools to achieve it effectively if you're searching for someone with expertise and experience using editing software. Furthermore, background music may provide pacing, intrigue, and a sense of setting to the film.

## **Part 3: Utilize Professional Video Editing Software for Post-Production**

 When making an explainer video, choosing the correct editing program may make all the difference. Different explainer video creators will provide you access to effects and asset libraries, which will make creating your video easier.

## Exploring AI Face Generators | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. Understanding AI Face Generators

AI face generators are at the forefront of cutting-edge technology, enabling the creation of remarkably authentic and diverse facial images through the ingenious application of deep learning techniques. At the heart of these generators lie concepts like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which synergize to produce digital faces indistinguishable from real individuals' photographs.  
Deep Learning Techniques At the core of AI face generators are GANs, a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence. GANs consist of two neural networks the generator and the discriminator. The generator crafts synthetic images while the discriminator assesses them for authenticity. Through a cyclic process of creation and evaluation, these networks continuously improve, resulting in ever-more convincing faces.  
Data Dynamics A diverse and comprehensive dataset of facial images serves as the training ground for AI face generators. This dataset encompasses faces of different ethnicities, ages, genders, and expressions, allowing the generator to grasp the subtleties contributing to an authentic appearance. Preprocessing techniques, like normalization and augmentation, refine the data, ensuring consistency and enhancing the generator's ability to create coherent faces.  
The Latent Space The concept of a "latent space" is pivotal to the functioning of AI face generators. A latent space represents a multi-dimensional area where vectors carry information that the generator transforms into facial features. By skillfully navigating this space, the generator can produce an array of facial characteristics, ranging from the eyes' shape to the lips' curl.

## Part 2\. Four Key Components of AI Face Generators

AI face generators are complex systems that harness deep learning capabilities to craft lifelike facial images. Understanding their key components is essential to appreciating how these systems create convincing synthetic faces.

### 1\. Generator Network

At the heart of an AI face generator is the generator network. This network learns to transform random noise or latent vectors into detailed and coherent facial images. The generator deciphers patterns in the latent space through layers of neural connections to generate different facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth. As the network refines its understanding through training, it becomes increasingly adept at producing realistic faces.

### 2\. Discriminator Network

The discriminator network acts as the critic in the AI face generator setup. It learns to distinguish between authentic images and those generated by the generator. This adversarial dynamic between the generator and discriminator drives the overall improvement of the generated images. The generator strives to create images that can "fool" the discriminator into classifying them as accurate while the discriminator hones its ability to tell the difference.

### 3\. Latent Space and Noise Vector

The latent space is a multidimensional mathematical space where the generator operates. It's a representation of all possible facial features that the generator can create. A noise vector, often random values, serves as the starting point in the latent space. As the generator refines these noise vectors through its network layers, they transform into intricate facial characteristics, creating diverse and unique faces.

### 4\. Loss Functions

Loss functions are crucial in training AI face generators, particularly in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generator's loss function encourages it to create images convincing to the discriminator. The discriminator's loss function aims to correctly classify authentic and generated images. The interplay between these loss functions compels both networks to improve iteratively, resulting in increasingly realistic facial photos.

### 5\. Training Data and Preprocessing

The quality of training data significantly impacts the AI face generator's output. Diverse and representative datasets containing images of various ages, ethnicities, and expressions contribute to more realistic results. Preprocessing techniques like normalization and augmentation ensure consistency and enhance the generator's capacity to generate coherent faces.

### 6\. Styling and Customization

Advanced AI face generators can incorporate styling and customization options. These allow users to influence specific attributes of the generated faces, such as hairstyle, facial hair, or accessories. This customization capability enhances the generator's versatility for various applications, from character design in gaming to creating unique avatars.

Understanding these key components provides insight into the inner workings of AI face generators. These systems leverage the interplay of networks, data, and mathematical spaces to achieve their remarkable ability to generate facial images that blur the line between natural and synthetic.
