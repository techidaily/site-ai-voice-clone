There are several options when deciding which kind of video is appropriate for you. Here are some of the most well-liked and sensible choices.

## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)

AI can automate repetitive marketing tasks, such as email marketing, social media posting, and ad campaign optimization. This streamlines processes saves time, and increases efficiency.

#### **06**of 07 Sentiment analysis

AI algorithms can analyze social media and customer feedback data to gauge public sentiment and opinions about a brand or product. This helps in understanding customer perceptions and adjusting marketing strategies accordingly.

#### **07**of 07 Ad targeting and optimization

AI can analyze user data and behavior to optimize ad targeting, bidding, and placement. It helps deliver ads to the most relevant audience and maximize advertising effectiveness.

The benefits of AI marketing include improved efficiency, enhanced personalization, better targeting, data-driven decision-making, and increased customer satisfaction. By leveraging AI technologies, marketers can gain valuable insights, automate processes, and deliver more impactful and personalized marketing experiences.

## Part 3\. What potential risks might AI Marketing have?

With the advent of the AI marketing era, more and more companies or employees are embracing relevant technologies to empower their work. However, AI Marketing may have several potential risks:

#### 1\. Privacy Concerns

AI Marketing relies on collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, which raises privacy concerns. There is a risk of unauthorized access, misuse, or mishandling of personal information, leading to privacy breaches and potential legal issues.

#### 2\. Data Bias and Discrimination

AI algorithms used in marketing may unintentionally incorporate biases present in the data they are trained on. This can lead to discriminatory practices, targeting specific groups unfairly or reinforcing existing societal prejudices.

#### 3\. Lack of Transparency and Explainability

AI algorithms can be complex and challenging to interpret. Lack of transparency and explainability can raise concerns about marketing decisions, making it hard to understand why certain choices or recommendations are being made.

#### 4\. Overreliance on Automation

While automation can bring efficiency and scale to marketing processes, overreliance on AI without human oversight can lead to errors, misunderstandings, and missed opportunities. It's essential to strike a balance between automation and human involvement.

#### 5\. Negative Customer Experience

Poorly designed or implemented AI marketing strategies can result in negative customer experiences. Unintelligent targeting, excessive personalization, or intrusive marketing tactics can alienate customers and damage brand reputation.

#### 6\. Security Risks

AI systems used in marketing can be vulnerable to cyber attacks or hacking attempts. A breach in AI systems can lead to data theft, manipulation, or unauthorized access, posing significant security risks.

#### 7\. Ethical Considerations

AI Marketing raises ethical dilemmas, such as manipulating consumer behavior, creating addictive experiences, or using persuasive tactics that exploit vulnerabilities. Ensuring ethical practices and adhering to regulations are crucial to mitigate potential risks.

To mitigate these risks, it is important to implement strong data protection measures, ensure fairness and accountability in AI algorithms, promote transparency and explainability, conduct regular audits, and prioritize ethical considerations in AI Marketing strategies.
