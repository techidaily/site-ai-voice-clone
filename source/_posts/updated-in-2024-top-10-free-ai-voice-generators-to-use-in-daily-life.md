## Part 2: Where Can You Download Talking Stock Photos For Free?

 “Okay, I’m sold on talking photos! Where can I get them?”

 Glad you asked! We have collated a repository of 6 portals that offer quality talking stock photos and talking stock images that you can choose and use!

 **Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

 What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

 What self-respecting journalist or newsreader does not know about Getty Images? Getty has a repertoire of over 7,935,000 high-quality talking photos for you to choose from. That all but guarantees that you will be able to find the ones you want and like.

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

#### 2.3: Unsplash

 Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

#### 2.4: Pexels

![pexels talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-5.jpg)

 Pexels was founded in Germany just about a decade ago in 2014 and has since grown to house over 3.2 million free stock photos and videos. The platform features over 411,000 talking photos for you to choose from. Pexels is part of Canva since 2018, just 4 years since its release. Must be doing something great, right?

#### 2.5: Pixabay

![pixabay talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-6.jpg)

 Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik

![freepik talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-7.jpg)

 Freepik has been around since 2010 and is part of the Freepik Company that features other brands such as Flaticon, Slidesgo and Wepik. Freepik has over 1,052,000 talking photos for you to choose from.
