## Part 3\. Tips for Writing Prompts To Generate Videos From Text

 The key to**creating AI videos from text** is a good prompt. Unlike text-to-image generators, creating video prompts needs greater detail and clarity. With a good prompt, you can effectively guide the AI model in understanding the desired visual elements, narrative structure, and emotional context of the video.

 Here, we list a few tips to create good prompts for generating videos from text:

1. **Provide context**

 When crafting your AI video prompt, include specific information such as desired style, target audience, intended platform for posting (e.g., YouTube), and preferred tone (e.g., casual or formal). You can also indicate if you want high-definition video, like 4K videos.

1. **Be clear and specific**

 Although providing details is important, avoid unnecessary things that could confuse AI text-to-video generators. Keep your prompt clear and focused to ensure the AI understands your instructions accurately.

1. **Use descriptive language**

 Given that the AI will transform your text into videos, use descriptive language to depict characters, settings, actions, and objects vividly. This will help the AI create a more accurate representation of your vision.

1. **Incorporate keywords**

 Some AI video prompt platforms may support the use of tags or keywords to help generate video according to our intent. Use these keywords to influence the AI's output effectively.

1. **Structure the prompt effectively**

 Organize your prompt in a logical manner to ensure clarity and coherence. Start with an introductory sentence that summarizes the main idea or theme of the video. Then, break down the key elements or scenes you want to include.

 Moreover, pay attention to scene transitions. In case you need multiple scenes, make sure they transition smoothly to maintain a coherent flow when**generating videos from text** .

## Part 1\. A Basic Preview To "Live Shopping"

**Livestream selling** or live shopping refers to live product demonstrations on digital platforms. The retailer or host has to introduce themselves, their store, and sale before describing products. They explain each detail of the products and their prices while holding them in a direct video call. During that, ensure that followers can see the product and interact through comments.

 Customers perceive it as a lively shopping experience instead of websites loading products. It creates a sense of connection as people feel like shopping in physical stores. As**live selling** has a core element of being in real time, people can question and know about the product. Compared with traditional shopping, one can place an order through links mentioned in the livestream.

### Is It Beneficial To Sell Live in This Digital Industry?

 Live selling is an emerging way to attract customers to shop on online marketplaces. According to[research](#:~:text=76%25%20of%20US%20adults%20shop,at%20least%20once%20per%20week.) , 76% of US adults prefer shopping online for clothes and groceries. It focuses on customers’ desire to know about products that generate sales. Thus, it proves beneficial in many terms, among which a few are elaborated below:

#### 1\. Engaging and Updating Communication

 Businesses can directly engage with a broader audience by entering the live selling industry. They get knowledge about current product trends to introduce similar things. Besides, this method eliminates the need to target customers in-store or via e-mails. Now, businesses can market their product and live sales simultaneously.

#### 2\. Reduced Return Rates and Customer Satisfaction

 Before live selling, people need to search for what they want by visiting the official sites of brands. Also, they scroll to read honest product reviews for the validity of products. With live selling, customers can view the products and ask questions during the live sessions. Therefore, it lowers the return rates to 40% while increasing customer satisfaction and trust.

By leveraging the power of AI, organizations, and individuals can gain valuable insights, improve efficiency, and create innovative solutions across various domains.

## Part 2\. The underlying factors contributing to the rise of AI tools

The emergence of AI tools is a result of several factors coming together. Here are some background factors:

##### **01**of 05Growing data volume

The digital age and widespread adoption of the internet have led to the generation and storage of vast amounts of data. The scale and complexity of this data have increased rapidly, making traditional data processing methods inadequate. AI tools can handle large-scale data and extract useful information from it, making them a solution to meet this demand.

##### **02**of 05Advancements in hardware and computing power

With the continuous improvement of computer hardware and processing capabilities, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and cloud computing technologies, AI tools can perform complex computations faster and more accurately. This provides a robust infrastructure for the development and utilization of AI tools.

##### **03**of 05Progress in algorithms and models

Algorithms and models in the field of AI have been continuously evolving and improving. For example, the rise of deep learning models enables computers to better process complex data types such as images, speech, and natural language. These advancements enable AI tools to handle and analyze data with greater accuracy and efficiency.

##### **04**of 05Business needs and competitive pressures

Businesses face increasingly fierce competition and ever-changing market demands. AI tools offer an innovative and intelligent way to address these challenges. By leveraging AI tools, organizations can optimize their operations, improve products and services, and enhance their competitiveness.

##### **05**of 05Drive from scientific research

The investment in AI technology by academia and research institutions has been a driving force behind the development of AI tools. The efforts and innovations of researchers have propelled advancements in algorithms and models, providing a theoretical and practical foundation for the development of AI tools.

In conclusion, the emergence of AI tools is the result of multiple factors interacting, including the growth of data, advancements in hardware and computing power, progress in algorithms and models, as well as business needs, and the drive from scientific research. These background factors collectively contribute to the development and application of AI tools.

## Part 3\. How to treat AI tools?

Our attitude towards AI tools can vary because they can be influenced by various factors, including cultural differences, societal demands, ethical considerations, responsible usage, and understanding of their limitations. The key is to strike a balance between embracing the potential benefits of AI tools while also addressing the ethical considerations and potential challenges they may present.
