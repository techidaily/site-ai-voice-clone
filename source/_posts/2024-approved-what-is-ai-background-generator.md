![yandex translate vs google translate](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/how-to-use-yandex-browsers-video-translation-feature-a-step-by-step-guide-5.jpg)

 When you need translation for a wider range of languages and platforms, you will find Google Translate a better option.

It is also more useful when you are interested in translating live streams and news broadcasts in a foreign language. In the end, both search engines are helpful and will achieve the desired goal.
