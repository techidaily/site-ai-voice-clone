![talking photo banner](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What Are Talking Stock Photos and What Can You Do With Them?

 Let’s answer the most pressing question on your mind first. What are talking photos? Talking photos, simply put, are photos brought to life with video and voice. No longer are your photos just images – they can now include voice along with motion. That is one of the several uses of generative artificial intelligence that’s taking the world by storm. With talking photos, not only do you have a memory as image, but you can have the memory with voice and video to make it more life-like. In some uses, this can be deeply comforting to us.

#### 1.1: Uses of Talking Photos

 What can talking photos be used for? Talking photos can be used for fun as well as for interactive education. Here are some uses of talking photos, in a gist:

* An interactive and more engaging learning experience for children.
* Convey emotions better.
* Send personalized messages with voice!
* Capture viewer attention right from the start.
* Create memories by adding voice to photos for a more vivid memory experience!
* Your social media shares can become that much more interesting and engaging.

## Part 2: Where Can You Download Talking Stock Photos For Free?

 “Okay, I’m sold on talking photos! Where can I get them?”

 Glad you asked! We have collated a repository of 6 portals that offer quality talking stock photos and talking stock images that you can choose and use!

 **Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

 What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

 What self-respecting journalist or newsreader does not know about Getty Images? Getty has a repertoire of over 7,935,000 high-quality talking photos for you to choose from. That all but guarantees that you will be able to find the ones you want and like.

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

#### 2.3: Unsplash

![unsplash talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-4.jpg)

 Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

#### 2.4: Pexels

![pexels talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-5.jpg)

 Pexels was founded in Germany just about a decade ago in 2014 and has since grown to house over 3.2 million free stock photos and videos.

#### 2.5: Pixabay

 Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik

![freepik talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-7.jpg)

 Freepik has been around since 2010 and is part of the Freepik Company that features other brands such as Flaticon, Slidesgo and Wepik. Freepik has over 1,052,000 talking photos for you to choose from.

AI video makers typically offer functionalities such as automatic video editing, scene recognition, visual effects, subtitle generation, voiceover synthesis, and music suggestions. These tools are designed to make video creation more accessible and efficient for users, regardless of their level of expertise in video editing.

### 2\. AI Video Generator

On the other hand, an AI video generator is an AI system that can autonomously produce videos from scratch without human intervention. These generators use AI algorithms, often powered by deep learning techniques, to create videos based on specific input parameters or data. For example, an AI video generator could take images, text, or audio inputs and use them to generate a complete video sequence. The generated videos may be entirely fictional or based on real-world data, depending on the system's design and purpose.

In summary, the main difference lies in their primary functions: an AI video maker assists users in the video creation process. In contrast, an AI video generator autonomously produces videos without human intervention. Both concepts leverage AI technology to enhance video-related tasks, but they serve different purposes and cater to other use cases. challenges they may present.

## Part 1.**What is an AI video maker?**

AI video maker refers to a video creation tool that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automate or enhance various aspects of the video production process. These tools often integrate machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to perform tasks such as video editing, scene recognition, automated video generation, voiceover synthesis, and more.

With AI video makers, users can create professional-looking videos more efficiently and with less manual effort. These tools can analyze raw video footage, apply filters, add visual effects, generate subtitles, and even suggest relevant music or soundtracks based on the video's content. Some AI video makers can also create videos from scratch using provided assets, such as images and text, transforming them into dynamic and engaging visual presentations.

The use of AI in video creation has significantly simplified the process and made it accessible to individuals and businesses without specialized video editing skills. As AI technology advances, AI video makers will likely become even more sophisticated, allowing for more creative and innovative video productions.

## Part 2\. Any differences between an AI video maker and a generator?

Yes, there is a difference between an AI video maker and an AI video generator, although they are related concepts.
