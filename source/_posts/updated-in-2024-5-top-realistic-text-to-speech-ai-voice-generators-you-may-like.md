## Free MSNBC Live: Online Stream for the Latest Shows for All Devices

 MSNBC is amongst the top cable news networks especially on Facebook, edging even Fox News and CNN. It contains some of the hottest shows that are loved by most Americans. MSNBC delivers news, articles, videos, and TV shows for all devices and across all audiences.

 But being a paid service, it chases away a lot of the users. So, if you want to watch the MSNBC live stream free, we have got the perfect list of websites that will allow you to watch your favorite shows without spending credits or money.

## **Part 1:** Best 5 Free MSNBC Live Streaming Sites

### 1\. LiveNewsChat

 One aspect of LiveNewsChat that we did not like is that it has a lot of annoying pop-up ads. But the quality pays for the hindered user experience which makes LiveNewsChat one of the best platforms for**MSNBC live streaming free online.**

![Live HD TV](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-2.jpg)

[Live HD TV](https://www.livehdtv.net/msnbc-news/) is amongst the nicest-looking websites on the list. However, it doesn’t just look nice but has a utility that would boost your user experience to the fullest. Aside from MSNBC, there are a plethora of other channels as well like CBC, ABC, CBS, and other news channels.

 What’s unique about Live HD TV is that it provides you with multiple servers for MSNBC, which means that you can switch the servers if one of the links is not working. The platform also displays ads minimally, with the player box not showing ads, which basically means that ads are nowhere to be found on this platform. So, if you want to**watch MSNBC live,** then there is no better choice than a platform like Live HD TV.

[STREAMFARE](https://streamfare.com/msnbc) takes things to the next level by providing the simplest experience you can demand. As soon as you enter the website, you are greeted with a video player that would instantly play the live MSNBC show.

 But what’s more interesting is that the video player and the servers that are used in this platform also allow you to have complete control over your video quality. Sure, you are not getting the 4K quality here but you can still control it up to 720p.

 There are advanced options too that are related to ad control, latency, and more. So, if you are ever having a problem on the platform, you can manually fix it. All in all, STREAMFARE is one of the best**MSNBC live streams free online** that you can experience and have fun watching.

### 4\. LiveNewsMag

![LiveNewsMag](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-4.jpg)

[LiveNewsMag](https://www.livenewsmag.com/msnbc-news-live-stream/) has one of the prettiest website designs and it allows you to watch MSNBC Live for free. However, there’s a catch. You will need to experience ads since the website won’t even work even if you have an ad blocker installed and activated.

 However, you can join LiveNewsPro which will disable ads for your particular account on the platform. LiveNewsMag provides one of the fastest loading times and although you will be greeted with ads from time to time, you are still getting live news on MSNBC right in the LiveNewsMag platform.

#### Features

| **Aspects**         | Performance                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

### 5\. FreeInterTV

![FreeInterTV](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-5.jpg)

[FreeInterTV](http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2565) is an all-in-one package that also displays MSNBC news online. It is a great platform and a free alternative to the original website. However, the magic of this platform is that it provides you with most TV channels from all across the world.

 The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

 Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.

#### Features

| **Aspects**         | Performance                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Ads**             | Ad free                          |
| **Loading Speed**   | Excellent loading speed          |
| **Quality**         | Up to 720p (HD) but usually 480p |
| **User Experience** | Confusing design                 |
