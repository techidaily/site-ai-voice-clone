 What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

 Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik

![freepik talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-7.jpg)
