 The world of e-commerce has gone through a tremendous transformation in the recent past, with terms like **live commerce** , live streaming, live shopping, and live chat becoming a norm. S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

 The use of live commerce features has made significant impacts on business industries. From collaboration with influencers to engaging viewers in consultation, the following brands have transformed their engagement through live online shopping:

## Part 2: Important Factors to Consider While Translating Videos

 In the vibrant landscape of digital content, the ability to transcend linguistic boundaries is a crucial aspect of reaching a diverse audience. When venturing into the realm of video translation, it's essential to consider various factors to ensure an accurate and meaningful representation of your content. Let's delve into the key considerations that can significantly impact the quality of your video translations.

### 1.Content Accuracy

 In the intricate dance of video translation, accuracy takes center stage. When selecting a video translation tool, it's imperative to prioritize those that not only promise but guarantee precise content translation. The soul of your message lies in its accuracy, and choosing a tool that preserves the essence and nuances of the original message establishes a deep and meaningful connection with your viewers through every frame of the translated content.

### 2.Language Support

 The beauty of global content creation lies in its linguistic diversity. Opt for a video translator that transcends language boundaries—a true polyglot. Choosing a tool with broad language support empowers you to cater to the diverse linguistic preferences of your audience, creating an inclusive and accessible viewing experience. Your selected tool should be a gateway to a world where language is not a barrier but a bridge.

### 3.Subtitle Customization

 Visual elements, especially subtitles, contribute significantly to the overall viewer experience. Seek a video translator that goes beyond the basics, offering options for customizing subtitles. The ability to adjust not only the appearance but also the timing of subtitles ensures that your translated content aligns seamlessly with the rhythm and tone of your original video. This customization transforms your subtitles from a mere translation tool to an integral part of your storytelling.

### 4.User-Friendly Interface

 In the fast-paced and dynamic landscape of content creation, efficiency is the key to success. Choose a video translation tool adorned with a user-friendly interface—a design that is intuitive and serves as a compass guiding both beginners and experienced users effortlessly through the translation process. A tool that feels familiar and accessible contributes not only to a smoother workflow but also to a more enjoyable and productive content creation experience.

### 5.Offline Functionality

 In a world where the ubiquity of the internet is not guaranteed, the ability to navigate offline is a valuable asset. Consider a video translator that offers offline capabilities, allowing you to enjoy translated content even when a stable internet connection is elusive. This feature provides convenience and flexibility, ensuring your content creation journey is not hindered by connectivity constraints.
