 Spanish has formal and informal forms of address. Make sure the Spanish to English video translation tool reflects the appropriate level of formality based on the context and relationship between the conversing parties.

##### **03** of 10 Be Mindful of Idioms

 Idiomatic expressions in Spanish don’t always have direct equivalents in English. AI tools may struggle with these, so be ready to simplify or rephrase to convey the intended message accurately.

##### **04** of 10 Review Regional Variations

 Spanish varies across regions. For instance, Spanish in Latin America is vastly different from Spanish in Spain. Therefore, you should consider the target audience's region and adjust translations accordingly, especially for colloquialisms and regional vocabulary.

##### **05** of 10 Verify Technical Terms

 For specialized or technical content, verify that the Spanish video translator understands and translates industry-specific terms correctly. You can provide additional context in the preview if needed.

##### **06** of 10 Double-Check Tenses

 Spanish and English express time differently. Ensure the AI captures the correct tense, especially in complex sentences, to convey the intended temporal meaning accurately.

##### **07** of 10 Handle Gender Sensitively

 Spanish had a binary (masculine/feminine) gender system only, while US English has multiple. Ensure the AI translates gender-sensitive terms appropriately and consistently throughout the text.

##### **08** of 10 Consider Sentence Structure

 Spanish and English have different sentence structures. Verify that the translated text maintains clarity and coherence while respecting the syntactic rules of the target language.

##### **09** of 10 Proofread and Edit

 AI tools may not catch nuanced errors. So, if you want to translate voice/videos from Spanish into any language, proofread the translated text. Check for grammatical accuracy, style, and overall fluency. Make necessary edits to enhance readability.

##### **10** of 10 Add Human Touch

 While AI tools are a great help for translation, they lack the nuanced understanding that humans possess. For critical or sensitive content, consider reviewing the AI-generated translations by a human translator to ensure accuracy and cultural appropriateness
