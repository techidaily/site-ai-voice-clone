 Live selling is an emerging way to attract customers to shop on online marketplaces.

It focuses on customers’ desire to know about products that generate sales. Thus, it proves beneficial in many terms, among which a few are elaborated below:

#### 1\. Engaging and Updating Communication

 Businesses can directly engage with a broader audience by entering the live selling industry. They get knowledge about current product trends to introduce similar things. Besides, this method eliminates the need to target customers in-store or via e-mails. Now, businesses can market their product and live sales simultaneously.

#### 2\. Reduced Return Rates and Customer Satisfaction

 Before live selling, people need to search for what they want by visiting the official sites of brands. Also, they scroll to read honest product reviews for the validity of products. With live selling, customers can view the products and ask questions during the live sessions. Therefore, it lowers the return rates to 40% while increasing customer satisfaction and trust.

The audience also has a visual representation of spoken language for quick learning. They also clarify any misunderstandings of dialogues and maintain consistency.

This provides a robust infrastructure for the development and utilization of AI tools.

##### **03**of 05Progress in algorithms and models

Algorithms and models in the field of AI have been continuously evolving and improving. For example, the rise of deep learning models enables computers to better process complex data types such as images, speech, and natural language. These advancements enable AI tools to handle and analyze data with greater accuracy and efficiency.

##### **04**of 05Business needs and competitive pressures

Businesses face increasingly fierce competition and ever-changing market demands. AI tools offer an innovative and intelligent way to address these challenges. By leveraging AI tools, organizations can optimize their operations, improve products and services, and enhance their competitiveness.

##### **05**of 05Drive from scientific research

The investment in AI technology by academia and research institutions has been a driving force behind the development of AI tools. The efforts and innovations of researchers have propelled advancements in algorithms and models, providing a theoretical and practical foundation for the development of AI tools.

In conclusion, the emergence of AI tools is the result of multiple factors interacting, including the growth of data, advancements in hardware and computing power, progress in algorithms and models, as well as business needs, and the drive from scientific research. These background factors collectively contribute to the development and application of AI tools.

## Part 3\. How to treat AI tools?

Our attitude towards AI tools can vary because they can be influenced by various factors, including cultural differences, societal demands, ethical considerations, responsible usage, and understanding of their limitations.
