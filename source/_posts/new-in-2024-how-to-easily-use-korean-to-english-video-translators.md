## Part 2\. What Should Be Present in A Good Subtitle Translator Tool?

 Considering the significance of subtitle translation, you might be looking for a good translator. There are many choices available on the internet depending on the use cases and preferences. Selecting the right tool is important for maintaining the quality and security of the content. Let us make your decision easier by informing you what aspect a good**movie subtitle translator** should have.

1. **Multi-language Support:** A tool is useless if it's not offering the language you want for translation. Thus, you should look for a tool that provides translation in a maximum number of languages. Avoid using any online movie subtitle translator that only offers basic language translations.
2. **Real-time Preview:** A good movie subtitle translator provides a real-time preview of the changes. This way, you can assess the quality and accuracy before downloading the movie. It proves beneficial in ensuring that subtitles are not overloaded and maintaining a flow.

6. **Export Options:** There are a variety of platforms that people use for watching movies. Distributors want movies in different formats to share them on every streaming stage. So, a good tool must offer many export options after translating subtitles to play anywhere.
