## Part 1: How Text-to-Video AI Generators Work to Create Videos

 Text-to-video AI generators produce videos in an instant way. The first step involves the entering of input data. This data acts as a set of instructions, descriptions, characters, keywords, and other required details.

While creating the structure of the video, the tool selects relevant objects, backgrounds, transitions, graphics, and overlays. Afterward, the AI tool adds visual elements and effects to make a creative video. If the video is animated, the tool adds a sense of motion to the objects, backgrounds, and characters.

 Moreover, human emotion is also added according to the script's demand. If there are dialogues between the characters, the AI tool will use its TTS engine to produce voiceovers. During this process, relevant background music and sound effects are added to ensure the captivity of the video. Once the visual and audio data is generated, the tool merges each scene smartly.

 This rendering process also includes lip-syncing, transitions, and overall timing. Some AI tools also introduce quality control techniques to eliminate errors from the video.
