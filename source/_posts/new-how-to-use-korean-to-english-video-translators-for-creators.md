## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)

## What Is AI API?

## **Part 1\. What is AI API?**

AI API stands for "Artificial Intelligence Application Programming Interface." It is a set of predefined rules, protocols, and tools that allow developers to integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into their applications, websites, or software products without building AI algorithms from scratch. AI APIs provide access to various machine learning models and services, enabling developers to leverage AI technologies such as natural language processing, picture recognition, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text, language translation, and more.

APIs simplify the process of incorporating AI functionalities into applications, making it more accessible and efficient for developers to harness the power of AI without deep expertise in the field. Major tech companies and AI platforms offer AI APIs, allowing developers to tap into powerful AI services and integrate them seamlessly into their projects.

## **Part 2\. How can AI revolutionize the API?**

Introducing AI can bring several changes and enhancements to APIs, revolutionizing the way applications interact with users and handle complex data. With the integration of AI-powered capabilities, APIs can evolve from simple data processors to intelligent agents capable of understanding and adapting to user needs. These enhancements empower developers to create applications that offer users more personalized and engaging experiences.

One of the significant advantages of AI-powered APIs is the ability to add natural language interfaces, allowing users to interact with applications using spoken or written language. This shift towards more intuitive interactions eliminates the need for complex user interfaces, making applications more accessible and user-friendly for a broader audience.

Moreover, AI can provide predictive analytics, enabling APIs to forecast future trends and patterns based on historical data. This valuable feature equips businesses with data-driven insights, facilitating better decision-making and strategic planning.

The introduction of AI also leads to automation within APIs, streamlining various processes and reducing the manual effort required. This automation enhances efficiency, saving time and resources while ensuring consistent and reliable results.

Security is another crucial aspect that benefits from AI integration. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, AI-powered APIs can continuously monitor and detect potential threats, ensuring a proactive approach to cybersecurity. This advanced security layer protects sensitive data and mitigates risks, fostering trust between users and applications.
