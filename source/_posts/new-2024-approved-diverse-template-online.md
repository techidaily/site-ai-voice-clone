 Yes! It is possible to rank videos on the go as you go live. By doing YouTube research, you can leverage different keywords and rank for them as you go online. Most people make evergreen videos and put pre-recorded ones but compared to them, the live world is still small.

 That is exactly your ticket to success. First, you need to understand the problems that your audience has. How can you solve them? What concerns do they have on a particular topic? Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.

 It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.

### 4\. Building a community

 We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.

 First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.

 But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.

### 6\. Collaboration

![Collaboration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-7.jpg)

 Once you grow a little bit, you can collaborate with other streamers to join two audiences together. If you look closely, we have multiple streamers connecting with each other and having fun together.

 When you collaborate with someone and entertain the audience in a way that they want to be, You need to not only build a community of people but also collaborate with other streamers which will open new aspects of your streaming journey.

![Stream not starting](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-8.jpg)

 One of the most common problems with YouTube Live is streams not starting. Imagine you have an audience of people waiting but the stream just does not start. It can be unresponsive, which is a common issue with YouTube Live.

 Here’s what you can do to fix the issue. Firstly, you need to verify your account and wait for 24 hours for this issue to be fixed. It is because new channels need this type of verification to allow you to start streaming.

 However, if that still doesn’t fix the issue, you should try restarting your streaming service and computer. After a good reset, you can start streaming again and it should get you up and running.

### 2\. Poor video and audio quality

 We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

 Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

### 3\. Laggy stream

![Laggy stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-10.jpg)

 Similar to poor video and audio, a laggy stream can occur due to a bad internet connection. Most streamers have a plethora of applications opened in the background that all take some level of internet.

 Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.

![Lack of interaction on stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-11.jpg)

 A lot of people suffer from a lack of interaction even if they have slowly started to build a respectable viewer count. So, what should you do in that situation? Actively engage with viewers by responding to comments, asking questions, and running polls/contests.

 Encourage viewers to interact with each other. Invite guests or co-hosts to add diverse perspectives. You should always be trying something new that would excite the viewers into taking part.

## Part 3\. What potential risks might AI Marketing have?

With the advent of the AI marketing era, more and more companies or employees are embracing relevant technologies to empower their work. However, AI Marketing may have several potential risks:

#### 1\. Privacy Concerns

AI Marketing relies on collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, which raises privacy concerns. There is a risk of unauthorized access, misuse, or mishandling of personal information, leading to privacy breaches and potential legal issues.

#### 2\. Data Bias and Discrimination

AI algorithms used in marketing may unintentionally incorporate biases present in the data they are trained on. This can lead to discriminatory practices, targeting specific groups unfairly or reinforcing existing societal prejudices.

#### 3\. Lack of Transparency and Explainability

AI algorithms can be complex and challenging to interpret. Lack of transparency and explainability can raise concerns about marketing decisions, making it hard to understand why certain choices or recommendations are being made.

#### 4\. Overreliance on Automation

While automation can bring efficiency and scale to marketing processes, overreliance on AI without human oversight can lead to errors, misunderstandings, and missed opportunities. It's essential to strike a balance between automation and human involvement.

#### 5\. Negative Customer Experience

Poorly designed or implemented AI marketing strategies can result in negative customer experiences. Unintelligent targeting, excessive personalization, or intrusive marketing tactics can alienate customers and damage brand reputation.

#### 6\. Security Risks

AI systems used in marketing can be vulnerable to cyber attacks or hacking attempts. A breach in AI systems can lead to data theft, manipulation, or unauthorized access, posing significant security risks.

#### 7\. Ethical Considerations

AI Marketing raises ethical dilemmas, such as manipulating consumer behavior, creating addictive experiences, or using persuasive tactics that exploit vulnerabilities. Ensuring ethical practices and adhering to regulations are crucial to mitigate potential risks.

To mitigate these risks, it is important to implement strong data protection measures, ensure fairness and accountability in AI algorithms, promote transparency and explainability, conduct regular audits, and prioritize ethical considerations in AI Marketing strategies.
