 Download and install the VPN app on your computer or smartphone. Most VPN providers offer apps for various devices and operating systems, making installation a breeze.

* **Step 3: Connect to the Server in the UK/Australia**

* **Step 4: Go to BBC, ITV, or SBS, and start streaming**

 Once connected to the VPN server, open your web browser or streaming app. Visit the websites of BBC iPlayer, ITV, or SBS. You can now access free World Cup streaming content and enjoy watching matches live or on-demand.

## Part III. Should I Pay for a TV Channel for World Cup Streaming?

 Considering whether to pay for a TV channel for World Cup streaming? It’s essential to weigh the costs and benefits against other available options.
