 MSNBC is amongst the top cable news networks especially on Facebook, edging even Fox News and CNN. It contains some of the hottest shows that are loved by most Americans. MSNBC delivers news, articles, videos, and TV shows for all devices and across all audiences.

 The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

 Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.

#### Features

2. **Product Demos:** Product demonstrations involve tutorials and guidelines in a detailed manner. You can give instructions to the audience to use your product in the correct way.
3. **Webinars:** You can also conduct webinars that act as online group events among particular individuals. Moreover, you can give an online presentation to the decision-makers of other businesses from any part of the world.
4. **Testimonials:** Testimonials are honest recommendations from previous clients to promote your product. This will help other people to trust your product by checking the experiences of your past clients.

## Part 2: Why is B2B Video Marketing Important?

**B2B video marketing** is essential to reach your targeted businesses easily. This section will highlight the significance of B2B video marketing in a brief manner.

### 1\. Visually Appealing and Engaging

**B2B YouTube** videos are naturally appealing due to their captivating visuals. That’s why B2B video marketing can effectively catch the attention of your targeted audience. You can add animation and use Avatars to add distinctiveness to your video. Moreover, you can embed your**B2B video** with an engaging audio track to make your audience attentive.

### 2\. Establishes Reliable Relation

 B2B videos can instantly add authenticity to your brand or product. Once your audience verifies your brand's true identity, it will automatically establish a trustworthy relationship. Moreover, this will add credibility to your business, optimizing your growth. Therefore, B2B videos can bridge the gap between you and your targeted business organization.

### 3\. Offers Expertise and Clear Demonstration

 To sell your business product, you should demonstrate its key advantages. You can give your expertise through B2B videos with visual representation. Moreover, you can give your audience a proper demonstration to use your product without difficulty. Your viewers would also be able to absorb the guidelines through a video rather than reading a descriptive text.

### 4\. Free Advertisement

 Do you want to promote your brand name and product? B2B videos work as free advertisements as they have a high chance of going viral on social media platforms. You may have encountered**B2B** **YouTube** videos in which you can see the key selling points of a particular product or service. Once your B2B video gets viral, you will get recognition from diverse audiences globally.

## Part 3: How to Use Video Marketing in Your B2B Strategy?

 If you combine video marketing with a B2B strategy, you can effortlessly strive in your business. In this section, we will offer you authentic guidance to utilize B2B video marketing effectively.
