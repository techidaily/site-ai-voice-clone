#### Alibaba International

###### Operational Steps

* **Prepare Equipment, Network, and Browser**
* **Install Virtual Sound Card**  
  * Due to audio restrictions on Alibaba International, a virtual sound card is required. If your computer's sound device has a "stereo mix," it can be used as an alternative. Check the path: My Computer - Properties - Sound - Sound Control Panel - Recording.
* **Set Up "Stereo Mix"**  
  * Skip this step if using a virtual sound card.  
  * Click My Computer - Properties - Sound - Sound Control Panel - Recording, activate stereo sound effects, and set it as default.  
  * Click Properties - Listen, select your speaker device, and click OK.  
  * Confirm the settings by playing a video on your computer. If both speakers and the microphone show sound detection, the setup is successful.
* **Download and Install OBS**  
  * As Alibaba International has restrictions on webcams, OBS is needed as a virtual camera (future Virbo Live product features will support this).  
  * After installation, go to Settings - Video and change the resolution to "1080x1920." Select the "+" sign - Window Capture, and add the window of the Live Explosion (Live Version).  
  * Crop the URL bar by holding Ctrl + left-click. Click "Start Virtual Camera."
* **Prepare Materials**
* **Initiate the Live Stream**
* **Start Live Streaming on Alibaba Seller's Live Companion**  
  * Log in to Alibaba Seller, open the live stream, and the Alibaba Live Companion window will pop up.  
  * Choose "Free Mode," add the camera, select Logitech c930e, and display it to cover the entire screen.

## Voicemod AI Review Transforming Your Voice in Real Time

 Voice modulation tools like **Voicemod AI** have become trendy nowadays. With voice-changing software, you can transform your voice into a celebrity, monster, or any other character and prank your friends online. This technology can also be helpful with video narrations and gaming, where you don’t need to reveal your voice. But to achieve that, you must research the best voice modulation program. So, in this post, we want to introduce you to how to use**Voicemod AI voices** to sound differently on video games, VoIP apps, video narrations, and more. You’ll also know the best alternative to this AI-powered program.

## Part I. A Quick Overview of Voicemod AI

 Voicemod AI is a Windows/Mac program designed to change your voice in real-time. This software packs a range of AI voices to change your persona in your online interactions. With this program, you can sound almost like anything, including monsters, chipmunks, males, females, children, celebrities, and more. Even better, Voicemod has frequent updates with new AI voices.

 So, where can you use the AI voices on this program? Voicemod is a pretty flexible program that allows you to achieve quite a lot. That’s because this program will modulate your voice in real-time, allowing you to shake things up on Discord group chats, Skype video calls, Steam gaming sessions, and other applications. You can even use it to create unique YouTube content and carve out your brand.

## Part II. Features and Capabilities

 You must be asking yourself why we singled out Voicemod AI of all the AI voice modulation programs out there. The thing is that Voicemod comes with special features that can make your voice stand out in the group. Also, this tool is designed to give you a seamless voice-changing session. Let’s look at some of its shining points!

### 1\. Real-time voice modulator

 Voicemod allows you to process voices in real-time, making it the ideal software for streaming on Twitch or making fun calls on Zoom. The AI voice generator has been extensively trained by voices from professional actors to give you human-like narrations. You only need to connect your mic to stream content with**Voicemod AI voice** . We’ll show you how to do that in this guidepost.

### 2\. Extensive variety of voice effects

 Voicemod comes with more than 100 voice effects, with this voice-changing software adding more voices with new updates. The massive library of voice effects and sound modification features means you’ll get unlimited experience with Voicemod. It’s one of the few programs that allows you to modify your voices with reverb, pitch, chorus, vocoder, and other customization features.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

 You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices. With it, you can create voices from scratch by combining different audio effects and processors like reverb, pitch shifter, filter, and more. Once you have made a custom voice, proceed to name it, add an avatar, and add it to the voice control panel. This is an excellent way to create unique voices you cannot find anywhere else.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:

**Step 1.** Install Voicemod on your Windows 7/10/11 PC or Mac computer and run it.

**![install and run voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-1.jpg)**

**Step 2.** Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.

![enter sound settings on voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-2.jpg)

**Step 3.** Ensure that the**Voice Changer** toggle at the bottom of the Voicemod home window is enabled. Then, click the**Voicebox** tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.

![choose a voice effect on voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-3.jpg)

**Step 4.** If the voice is working, head to the application or browser tab where you want to apply the voice effect to start streaming. That’s it!

**Note:** Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.

## Part III. Real User Experience

 So, what was our user experience with**AI Voicemod** ? To be honest, Voicemod is one of the best if not the best, voice modulator programs. We were impressed by how easily it picks up sounds on our microphone. The range of voice effects and customization options is also impressive, to say the least. And yes, the platform itself looks stylish and modern.

 But this program’s main drawback comes from its major strength. Although Voicemod is a feature-rich program, beginners might feel intimidated at first. You may need to follow the developer’s guide to connect your microphone appropriately and customize the sound settings. Overall, Voicemod isn’t for green hands, although it’s fun to use once you get the hang of it.

## Part IV. Pricing and Plans

 Although Voicemod is free, you must upgrade to the Pro version to unlock all the voice effects and capabilities. Thankfully, the Voicemod subscription plan is one of the most competitive. You can opt for the One-Time Payment at**$59.00** , although the program often has**50% off** for new installations. You can also choose the Annual plan of**$23.88** or the 3-month plan of**$11.97** .

Below are some of the advantages you’ll get with Voicemod Pro:

* Design your unique voices from scratch with VoiceLab.
* Unlimited MP3 and WAV audio uploads.
* Complete Voicebox with 80+ pre-made voice effects.
* Receive new voices and themed soundboards every month.
* Unlock all AI voice filters.

## Bonus Tips: Try the Best Alternative to Voicemod AI - Virbo

 Voicemod might stand out as one of the best voice-changing software around. But, this program has a few drawbacks, primarily complex usability. Also, Voicemod only works with audio files and live microphone recordings. This begs the question: what if you want to add a voice effect to a video and share it online?

 In that case, [Wondershare Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/)  is the best alternative to Voicemod AI. With this AI-backed desktop program, you can create video templates with 150+ free avatars and 120+ voiceovers.

![record a voiceover](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-7.jpg)

**Step 4.** Preview the video and change the sound effects by choosing a new avatar if needed. If satisfied, tap**Export** to save your video template with AI voice. That was easy, right?
