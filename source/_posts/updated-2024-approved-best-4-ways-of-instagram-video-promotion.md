S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

 Pick trustworthy, best rap voice generators. After reading feedback from customers and listening to demos, select software that produces real-sounding vocal outputs. A rap generator investment will significantly raise the overall caliber of your music.

 Select a voice generator that supports several languages, if your project requires multiple languages. Whether it's an online tool or interacts with your current editing program, be sure the voice generator works properly with your desired software or platform.

### 2\. Refine delivery

 AI rappers can be of great help if you practice and perfect your delivery. Work on your delivery, flow, and timing to produce a nice mix with**AI rap voices** . You'll sound more skilled and professional in your recordings if you regularly practice.

 Practice the rap lyrics and repeat them over and over until they come naturally. To bring out wordplay and punchlines, try out various tones and inflections with the voice generator. If you want to give longer verses without being out of breath, practice your breathing skills.

### 3\. Balance Realism and Creativity

 Try to establish a balance between accurate vocal production and creative experimentation. While maintaining authenticity is necessary, don't be afraid to experiment with novel vocal effects or styles. Use**AI rap voice generators** to express your creativity and add unique touches to the voice.

Make sure that the main point you want to express doesn't get lost in the use of the voice generator.

### 5\. Avoid Overuse

 Although rap voice machines are helpful tools, you shouldn't utilize them in your music too frequently. Find a balance between synthetic vocals to preserve authenticity and avoid a synthetic or robotic tone. Accept AI's promise to be a catalyst for creation while maintaining your unique voice and craft for a remarkable musical experience.

### 6\. Stay Ethical

 When combining AI-generated rap into your creative compositions, always give the platform or model utilized the appropriate credit and gratitude. Ensure you adhere to copyright and intellectual property laws and use AI-generated material responsibly and ethically.
