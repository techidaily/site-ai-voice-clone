Additionally, not every design will complement your brand and your available assets.

 So, let's go through the 8 finest explainer videos and when to employ explanation YouTube video before you start the creation.

## Part 1: What is an Explainer Video?

 Both start-ups and large enterprises employ corporate explainer videos. They are brief videos that highlight the characteristics and advantages of a service or how to utilize a product, and are often featured on website landing pages or in form of SaaS explainer videos. When thinking about making an explainer video for business, there are several of benefits to take into account. It provides your brand a fantastic chance to showcase its identity since it is enjoyable and imaginative.

 Product explainer videos are a clever and fashionable choice for engaging with clients since they are also inexpensive and simple to make. In fact, [explainer videos](https://topexplainers.com/how-effective-are-explainer-videos-statistics-and-how-to-step-by-step/)  have been so successful in converting viewers that some businesses have reported conversion rates as high as 81%. There are several options when deciding which kind of video is appropriate for you. Here are some of the most well-liked and sensible choices.

## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)

 Because of this, you have to think about the greatest and most practical instrument for making these animation videos. Your best option for that is[Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/) .

When you want to show the software in operation, this format is excellent. Additionally, live video may be supplemented by screencast videos while a person is using their phone or browsing the internet. They therefore get videos with no screenplay, poor narration, and no post-production.

![animated-explainer-videos-screencast-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-screencast-videos.jpg)

Screencast explanation videos are the ideal solution for young tech startups with little resources. It's excellent for highlighting the benefits of IT items like software or applications.

### 7. **Typography**

 The name of this fashion is quite self-explanatory. This is a strategy sometimes used by businesses looking to reduce their budget. In this kind of explainer video, the typefaces take on a life of their own and build the whole narrative. Although these videos may just employ one font or a variety, the words nonetheless have a significant effect.

![animated-explainer-videos-typography-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-typography-videos.jpg)

### 8. **Stop Motion**

 In order to make stop motion, a model is videoed one frame at a time, moved or adjusted slightly, and then the process is repeated. It draws attention since it is unique and has a unique artistic appeal. Additionally, it is expensive and complicated to produce; for that, you need a specialized studio and tools. This may be reproduced using a 2D or 3D animated environment thanks to contemporary technologies.

## Exploring Key Components and Creation Process of AI Face Generators

## Part 1\. Understanding AI Face Generators

AI face generators are at the forefront of cutting-edge technology, enabling the creation of remarkably authentic and diverse facial images through the ingenious application of deep learning techniques. At the heart of these generators lie concepts like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which synergize to produce digital faces indistinguishable from real individuals' photographs.  
Deep Learning Techniques At the core of AI face generators are GANs, a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence. GANs consist of two neural networks the generator and the discriminator. The generator crafts synthetic images while the discriminator assesses them for authenticity. Through a cyclic process of creation and evaluation, these networks continuously improve, resulting in ever-more convincing faces.  
Data Dynamics A diverse and comprehensive dataset of facial images serves as the training ground for AI face generators. This dataset encompasses faces of different ethnicities, ages, genders, and expressions, allowing the generator to grasp the subtleties contributing to an authentic appearance. Preprocessing techniques, like normalization and augmentation, refine the data, ensuring consistency and enhancing the generator's ability to create coherent faces.  
The Latent Space The concept of a "latent space" is pivotal to the functioning of AI face generators. A latent space represents a multi-dimensional area where vectors carry information that the generator transforms into facial features. By skillfully navigating this space, the generator can produce an array of facial characteristics, ranging from the eyes' shape to the lips' curl.

## Part 2\. Four Key Components of AI Face Generators

AI face generators are complex systems that harness deep learning capabilities to craft lifelike facial images. Understanding their key components is essential to appreciating how these systems create convincing synthetic faces.

### 1\. Generator Network

At the heart of an AI face generator is the generator network. This network learns to transform random noise or latent vectors into detailed and coherent facial images. The generator deciphers patterns in the latent space through layers of neural connections to generate different facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth. As the network refines its understanding through training, it becomes increasingly adept at producing realistic faces.

### 2\. Discriminator Network

The discriminator network acts as the critic in the AI face generator setup. It learns to distinguish between authentic images and those generated by the generator. This adversarial dynamic between the generator and discriminator drives the overall improvement of the generated images. The generator strives to create images that can "fool" the discriminator into classifying them as accurate while the discriminator hones its ability to tell the difference.

### 3\. Latent Space and Noise Vector

The latent space is a multidimensional mathematical space where the generator operates. It's a representation of all possible facial features that the generator can create. A noise vector, often random values, serves as the starting point in the latent space. As the generator refines these noise vectors through its network layers, they transform into intricate facial characteristics, creating diverse and unique faces.

### 4\. Loss Functions

Loss functions are crucial in training AI face generators, particularly in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generator's loss function encourages it to create images convincing to the discriminator. The discriminator's loss function aims to correctly classify authentic and generated images. The interplay between these loss functions compels both networks to improve iteratively, resulting in increasingly realistic facial photos.

### 5\. Training Data and Preprocessing

The quality of training data significantly impacts the AI face generator's output. Diverse and representative datasets containing images of various ages, ethnicities, and expressions contribute to more realistic results. Preprocessing techniques like normalization and augmentation ensure consistency and enhance the generator's capacity to generate coherent faces.

### 6\. Styling and Customization

Advanced AI face generators can incorporate styling and customization options. These allow users to influence specific attributes of the generated faces, such as hairstyle, facial hair, or accessories. This customization capability enhances the generator's versatility for various applications, from character design in gaming to creating unique avatars.

Understanding these key components provides insight into the inner workings of AI face generators. These systems leverage the interplay of networks, data, and mathematical spaces to achieve their remarkable ability to generate facial images that blur the line between natural and synthetic.
