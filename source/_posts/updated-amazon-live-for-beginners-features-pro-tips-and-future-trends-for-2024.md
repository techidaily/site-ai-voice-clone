## Part 2: Step Guidance: Getting Started with Amazon Live

 To create a livestream on Amazon, you need to be a U.S. Professional Seller either registered as a U.S. Vendor or in the Amazon Brand Registry. Sellers who meet the requirements can create their livestreams through the [Amazon Live Creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) mobile app.

![amazon live creator app](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-2.jpg)

 With Amazon streaming live service, you can record Livestream in advance and schedule them to go up at a later date or go Live in real-time. This will usually depend on your goals and the kind of interaction you want with your audience. In any case, Amazon recommends the use of an external camera and a video encounter instead of your mobile phone to ensure quality video. Although you can use either, an external camera gives you an edge in terms of quality. Let’s have a look at a detailed step-by-step guide to getting started with Amazon Live:

##### Step 1 Create an Amazon Live Account

 Download the [Amazon Live Creator app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) from the Apps Store. The app is currently only available for iOS and will work on iPhone or iPad. Sign into your Seller, Influencer, or Vendor account and create a Live Account.

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.
