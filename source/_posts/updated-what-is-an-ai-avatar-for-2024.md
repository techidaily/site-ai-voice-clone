 Half of the Youtubers make videos to get their channel to monetize. They aim to get more financially stable with YouTube video creation. If you also want to monetize your YouTube channel, there are a few factors that you need to keep in mind. YouTube monetization helps in defining your ability to attract viewers.

 The monetization requirement is a minimum of 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours in the past month. Moreover, you have to link to the AdSense account, and your location must be YouTube Partner Program supported.

#### 2\. How to select a niche for a YouTube channel?

 One of the basic yet irritating confusions YouTubers face is selecting a niche for their YouTube content. It is quite a big decision, and you have to be very careful on this part. Identify your interests initially for selecting the niche you can rely on without boredom.

 Following this, make sure you gain considerable knowledge about your niche. Knowing your competitors and discovering the tactics that can influence you to get better than them is also crucial. Take a deep breath, relax, and invest time while selecting a niche, because your YouTube carrier will depend on this.
