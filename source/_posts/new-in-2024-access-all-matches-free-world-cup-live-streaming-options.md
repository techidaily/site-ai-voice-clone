### **02 How artificial intelligence enhances the streaming experience**

 The use of artificial intelligence streams helps platforms stand out by providing relevant content. Platforms can use artificial intelligence to manage most of the processes in video streaming. This includes selection, content recommendation, and montage. As more uses of artificial intelligence streaming emerge, here are some notable impacts:

1. **AI-Powered Localization:** Platforms adapt their language and cultural approaches to enter foreign markets. With AI, the process of capturing, translating, and uploading subtitles is automated. Platforms like IMDB also use AI to source content titles, descriptions, and technical details.
2. **Audience Engagement:** With the help of machine language, platforms can accurately keep their audience engaged. AI helps to translate social media posts, catalog information, canned chat responses, knowledgebases, FAQs, website pages, and manuals.
3. **Content Protection:** With AI stream, platforms can protect their content and enhance user experience. AI helps to identify pirated streams, taking them down in a matter of minutes.
