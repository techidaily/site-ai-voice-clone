![Add sound to start recording TikTok video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-2.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Choose the duration and the part of the song.

 After choosing the song you want, you will return to the recording screen. Here, select your video duration at the bottom of the screen. You can choose between 10 minutes, 60 seconds, and 15 seconds. Remember that the duration of the songs on TikTok is usually only 30 to 60 seconds.

![Set the duration of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-3.jpg)

* **Step 4.** Choose the part of the song.

 TikTok allows you to change the part of the song when lip-sync. However, the duration of the video should be less than the duration of the chosen song.

 To do this, click on the song's name at the top of your screen. Then, the bottom of your screen will display your chosen song. Tap the scissor icon and slide the playback to change the part of the song. Click “Done” once you have finished editing.

 Creating a video on TikTok by lip-syncing is a fun and creative way to express yourself and connect with others. By following the steps above, you can create a lip-sync video on the TikTok app with ease. Keep in mind that by using these steps, you need to memorize the sentences and understand the beat of the chosen songs.

## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

![Set a timer to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-8.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Start the recording

 Then click “Start recording” to record the video with the timer on.

### Method 3: Use a Photo Talking Tool
