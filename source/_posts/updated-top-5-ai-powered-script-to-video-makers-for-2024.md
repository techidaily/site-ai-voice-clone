AI advertising has several advantages over traditional advertising:

#### 1.Intelligent targeting and personalized recommendations

AI advertising can accurately target and make personalized recommendations to users through data analysis and machine learning algorithms. It analyzes users' interests, behaviors, and preferences to deliver relevant and appealing ads, increasing click-through and conversion rates.

#### 2.Real-time optimization and precision

AI advertising can monitor ad performance in real time and optimize it based on user feedback and data metrics. It adjusts ad content, channels, and delivery strategies to improve ad relevance and effectiveness, giving advertisers better control over their ad budgets and outcomes.

#### 3.Automation and efficiency

AI advertising automates ad delivery, reducing manual intervention and labor costs. Advertisers can manage ad campaigns more efficiently and achieve better results by automating ad buying, placement, and optimization.

#### 4.Data-driven insights

AI advertising leverages data analysis and mining to provide deeper insights and decision support. Advertisers can better understand user behavior patterns, market trends, and competitor insights through data analysis, enabling them to make informed advertising decisions.

#### 5.Creative optimization and personalized content creation

AI advertising helps optimize ad creatives and content using machine learning and generative models. It generates personalized ad copy, images, and videos that cater to user needs and preferences, enhancing ad creativity and interactivity.

Overall, AI advertising harnesses the power of data and algorithms to deliver more accurate, intelligent, and personalized ads, improving ad effectiveness and user experience and generating better performance and returns for advertisers.

## Part 3\. Potential risks and challenges in AI advertising

#### 1.Privacy concerns

AI advertising relies on a large amount of user data for targeting and personalized recommendations, which can raise concerns about user privacy. Improper data handling and usage could lead to data breaches or misuse, resulting in privacy infringements.

#### 2.Bias and discrimination

AI algorithms used in advertising may be influenced by their own biases and prejudices. If algorithms are trained on biased or insufficiently diverse data, it could result in ads that target or exclude specific groups, leading to unfairness and discrimination.

#### 3.Fraud and false information

While AI advertising can predict and prevent fraud, there is still a risk of fraudulent activities and the spread of incorrect information through AI advertising systems. Malicious advertisers may exploit AI technology to deceive users or engage in fraudulent activities, undermining user rights and trust.

#### 4.Lack of human judgment and creativity

Although AI advertising can automate and optimize ad delivery, it may lack human judgment and creativity. Some advertising campaigns require more emotional appeal and creative factors that AI technology may have limitations in delivering.

To address these risks, regulatory agencies and relevant stakeholders need to establish appropriate policies and standards to ensure the compliance and ethicality of AI advertising. Technology developers and advertising practitioners should also strengthen monitoring, validation, and review processes for AI advertising systems to mitigate potential risks and issues.
