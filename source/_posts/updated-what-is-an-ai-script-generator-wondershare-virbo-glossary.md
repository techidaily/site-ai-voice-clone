 After processing comes the model architecture selection. This can vary, but the commonly used model is recurrent neural networks. This helps the**script generator AI** to train on several models and identify the structures and patterns. After initial training, the model is refined with the adjustments of versatile parameters to perform well as**AI** **movie script generators** ,**AI screenplay generators** , etc .
