## Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the**online live shopping** success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

 A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

 Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

 One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

 As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

Wondershare Virbo comes with 3 advanced features:

1. You can use the power of AI to create perfectly lip-synced videos in line with the target language. Try it to believe it!
2. Enable Subtitle option to burn the translated subtitles directly into the video. This should only be done if there are no subtitles already present in the video.

Today, you can auto translate subtitles online using any of the freely available online SRT translation tools. However, this guide shows you how to select the right tool for you, and as bonus, gives you an easy-to-use tool to translate videos into any language easily!
