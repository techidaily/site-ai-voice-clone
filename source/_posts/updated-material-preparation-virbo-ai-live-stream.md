You can transform your videos with the **Descript Overdub AI** feature. **Descript Overdub** uses AI voice cloning that replaces incorrect audio without re-recording it. That overdubbed audio can blend in with any audio conditions.

You'll get the same result whether you record with a different mic or at a different place. It can fix audio mistakes in seconds that otherwise would take hours of editing. This feature saves money and verifies ownership before creating your AI voice. Users can edit, record, collaborate, and publish their work all in one place.

### Limitations

Despite how many features Descript offers, there are still some limitations to using this tool. In the following section, we have highlighted some of these:

* Descript doesn't have a mobile app for editing videos. Many users find it convenient to record and edit content on a smartphone rather than on a desktop.
* This tool can sometimes be a bit slow, especially on a MacBook. While this is common for video editing tools, it can be irritating while making videos.
* While you can find various templates within the Descript library, the options are not flexible. Users are unable to find different options to choose template themes.
* Although the transcription quality is generally great, it always needs some post-editing. Descript does not automatically update all changes of a word after fixing it in the transcript.

### Pricing Plans

The pricing plan of Descript is very reasonable for content creators and provides valuable features with each plan. No matter if you are a beginner or a professional, the **Descript overdub** feature will help you with content creation tasks:

| Pricing Plan | Price         |
| ------------ | ------------- |
