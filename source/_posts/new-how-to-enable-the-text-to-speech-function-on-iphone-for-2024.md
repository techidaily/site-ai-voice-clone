* Step 2\. Customize the Live Stream Video in Virbo Live

 Once you find yourselves in the editing section, add a script you want to use in your live-stream video. While staying in the "Script lines" section, you can add a script in the form of text or audio. If you wish to add an audio script, go to the "Audio" tab and select "Upload local voice." This voice will then be used across the live stream video in Virbo Live.

### 2\. Pick an Appropriate Date and Time

 Another tip to consider is choosing the right time and date for the maximum viewers. In this regard, retailers should avoid a popular shopping period such as Black Friday. In contrast, it is suggested to pick weekends or holidays where customers must be free to join. Also, never choose the working hours of any day and consider the time zones for a global audience.

### 3\. Keep the Conversation Engaging and Funny

 Customers can read the product details and see how it looks, so what difference will they get from a live sale? Considering this perspective, sellers should bring something unique to the shopping stream. For this purpose, they can explain the product's benefits and use cases. Furthermore, they should keep their tone friendly and humorous for the targeted audience.
