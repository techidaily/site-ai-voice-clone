## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)

## Demystifying AI Game Generators | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. Explanation of what AI game generators are

An AI game generator is a cutting-edge software or system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automate and enhance various aspects of game development. It harnesses the power of machine learning, neural networks, and other AI methodologies to create, design, or assist in the creation of video games. Unlike traditional game development methods that heavily rely on manual design and coding, AI game generators offer a more automated and efficient approach.

## Part 2\. How do AI game generators differ from traditional game development methods?

AI game generators differ significantly from traditional game development methods in several key ways

### 1\. Automation and Efficiency

AI game generators automate various aspects of game development, such as content creation and level design, reducing the need for manual work.  
Traditional methods involve manual coding and design, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

### 2\. Speed of Development

AI game generators can rapidly generate game content and prototypes, speeding up development.  
Traditional methods may require extensive coding, design, and testing, leading to longer development cycles.

### 3\. Creativity and Innovation

AI game generators can introduce novel and unexpected elements by analyzing existing game data and patterns.  
Traditional methods use human creativity to design characters, levels, and gameplay mechanics.

### 4\. Personalization and Dynamic Content

AI game generators enable dynamic and personalized experiences by generating content based on player interactions.  
Traditional methods provide static content that's designed and coded beforehand.

### 5\. Resource Constraints

AI game generators can help smaller teams or indie developers overcome resource limitations by automating various tasks.  
Traditional methods require a larger team and more resources to create content and code from scratch.

### 6\. Iteration and Prototyping

AI game generators allow for rapid iteration and prototyping, enabling developers to test and refine ideas quickly.  
Traditional methods involve manual iteration and can be slower adapting to changes.

### 7\. Diverse Content Creation

AI game generators can produce various content variations, enhancing replayability and game diversity.  
Due to time and resource constraints, traditional methods may result in limited content.

### 8\. Human Expertise

AI game generators complement human expertise by automating routine tasks, freeing developers to focus on creative and strategic decisions.  
Traditional methods require developers to design, code, and implement every game element manually.

### 9\. Learning and Adaptation

AI game generators can learn from player behavior and adapt gameplay elements accordingly.  
Traditional methods rely on developers manually adjusting game elements based on feedback.

While AI game generators offer numerous advantages regarding efficiency, speed, and innovation, it's important to recognize that they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. They excel in automating certain tasks and enhancing creativity, but they are most effective when used with human expertise to create well-balanced and engaging gaming experiences.
