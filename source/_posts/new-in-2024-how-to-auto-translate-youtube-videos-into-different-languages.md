 ![NFL live stream for sports channel](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/get-more-nfl-viewers-for-sports-live-streaming-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Choosing a Platform for Your Live NFL Game Stream

 When considering getting NFL viewers, you need to know the best platform to stream live NFL games for your channel. Basically, you can always use any live streaming platform as long as you have OBS studio to work as a streaming encoder.

 Popular options include Twitch, YouTube Live, and Discord. Each platform has its unique advantages and demographics, so it's crucial to research and choose the one that aligns best with your target audience.

### Twitch

![NFL live stream on Twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/get-more-nfl-viewers-for-sports-live-streaming-2.jpg)

 Twitch is a popular choice for gaming content and has a large community of avid gamers and esports enthusiasts. It offers robust features such as chat integration, customizable overlays, and subscription options, which can help foster a sense of community and engagement among viewers.

 Pros

* Various monetization options, such as subscriptions, bits, and donations.

 Cons

### YouTube Live

![NFL live stream on YouTube Live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/get-more-nfl-viewers-for-sports-live-streaming-3.jpg)

 YouTube Live, on the other hand, boasts a massive user base and seamless integration with the rest of the YouTube platform. This means that your live streams can reach a broader audience, including those who may not necessarily be actively searching for NFL content but might stumble upon your stream while browsing related videos.

### Discord

![NFL live stream on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/get-more-nfl-viewers-for-sports-live-streaming-4.jpg)

 If you own a Discord server with sports fans, you can live stream NFL games free with your Discord server members. Discord provides a more private platform for streaming, so it minimizes concerns about your channel being restricted due to copyright violations or other issues when watching NFL live.

 Using the screen share feature on Discord, you can host streaming parties and interact with your audience in real time. Discord's platform also supports high-quality videos that guarantee a seamless and immersive viewing experience for everyone.

 Pros

* Customizable with various channels, roles, and bots to create unique experiences for their audience.
* Direct communication between streamers and viewers through text, voice, and video channels.
* Safer to be used for live streaming NFL games as it’s more private.

 Cons

* Lacks the discoverability of platforms like Twitch and YouTube.
* No built-in monetization options like subscriptions or ads.

 For live streaming the game, you can watch the NFL live on various[platforms and services](https://www.nfl.com/ways-to-watch/) . Some popular options include NFL+, Streaming Services (YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, and FuboTV), or Broadcast Networks (CBS, FOX, and ESPN). Alternatively, some of the NFL game live stream online free options are USTVGO, FSL, CricFree, and more.

 After knowing which streaming platform to use, it’s essential to proceed with caution. Live-streaming NFL games can present various challenges and considerations, including streaming quality, licensing agreements, potential copyright issues, and more.

## Part 2: Strategies to Implement During Live Streaming

 Now that you know which platform to use for your sports live-streaming channel, it’s time to strategize your live-streaming approach to maximize audience engagement and make your channel a go-to destination for NFL fans.

 During the NFL live stream, you’ll want to captivate your audience from kickoff to the final whistle. Engaging visuals, insightful commentary, and seamless transitions are important in keeping your audience hooked.

 Try out these strategies to attract your viewers during NFL live streaming:

1. **Make a Pre-game Analysis**

 Before the game begins, provide viewers with insightful analysis and predictions about the upcoming match. Discuss key players, recent team performances, and any strategic adjustments that could impact the game's outcome. This pre-game analysis helps build anticipation and engagement among viewers.

1. **Interactive Polls and Q&A Sessions**

 You can engage with viewers during the NFL livestream by incorporating interactive elements such as polls and Q&A sessions. Ask viewers to vote on game predictions, MVP candidates, or play of the game. Or, you can encourage viewers to ask questions or share their thoughts in the chat and respond to them to foster interaction and community engagement.

1. **In-game Commentary**

 You can provide play-by-play analysis, insights into player performances, and strategic observations throughout the NFL streams. Use visuals such as graphics, replays, and statistics to make your commentary more engaging and improve the viewing experience.

1. **Post-game Analysis and Highlights**

 After the game concludes, provide viewers with comprehensive post-game analysis and highlights. Recap key moments, analyze standout performances, and discuss the implications of the game on the team’s season to encourage continued engagement and discussion.

1. **Make Your Channel Discoverable**

 Make sure your NFL stream titles clearly state the sport or activity. Use tags like "Football" and add descriptors like "Sidecasting" or "Sports Talk" to give viewers an idea of what to expect.

 You can also personalize your NFL livestream to boost engagement. Add extensions such as alerts and overlays. Use templates from the platform or third-party tools to make your stream unique.
