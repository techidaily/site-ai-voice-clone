**2**How can I use an AI script generator effectively?

Effectively using an AI script generator requires **precise prompts and experimentation**. Clearly define genre, tone, and style, iterating as necessary. Review and edit the generated scripts to ensure alignment with your requirements and maintain consistency in a streamlined process.

**3**What are the limitations of AI script generators?

AI script generators have certain limitations. They rely heavily on the data they were trained on. They may also struggle with generating highly original or innovative content. Therefore, it's important to use AI-generated scripts as a starting point and apply human creativity and judgment to refine and improve the final result.
