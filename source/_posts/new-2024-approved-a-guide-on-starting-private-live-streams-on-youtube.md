## Part 3: Exploring Alternative Options and Solutions

 While Virbo shines brightly in the realm of video translation, the landscape offers a multitude of alternatives, each with its own unique strengths. Here are two notable alternatives, including the renowned Google Translate and Amara, inviting users to explore diverse paths to seamless video translation.

### 1.[Media.io](https://www.media.io/translate-video.html)

 It is an extensive online video translator app for PC catering to your personal, educational, or promotional needs. This platform allows you to edit videos, make AI video presentations, and cartoonist videos. Media.io has an AI video translator that translates videos in over 120 languages to expand your content's reach. With this AI-powered translator, you can transcribe videos and get subtitle translations.

![media.io translate video translator app for pc](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-video-translator-app-for-pc-1.jpg)

#### Features

1. Media.io can generate auto-subtitles in your video for visual aid in content comprehension. In this regard, users can also upload an existing subtitle file or add manual subtitles
2. Apart from adding subtitles, it lets you translate the generated subtitles into the videos. For this purpose, you must choose a targeted language, and AI will handle the remaining process.
3. After translating subtitles, you can change their styles to make the video appealing. Medi.io allows you to add text effects and change effect colors and fonts.

#### Pros

* It’s not a**video translator app for PCs** ; it is web-based software available to all web browsers.
* While exporting the results, you can export subtitle files separately or render them in the videos.
* Despite translating, users can perform other editing tasks, such as adding music and transitions.

#### Cons

* This tool doesn’t allow you to translate your content for free.
* The translation may not be accurate and may lack your targeted language's nuances and idioms.

### 2.[Amara](https://amara.org/)

 In the process of video translation, where language serves as both a barrier and a bridge, Amara emerges as a collaborative haven, inviting users to shape linguistic narratives collectively. A platform celebrated for its community-driven approach, Amara not only translates videos but also fosters a shared language experience. Let's delve into the features, pros, and cons that define Amara's distinctive role in the world of video translation.
