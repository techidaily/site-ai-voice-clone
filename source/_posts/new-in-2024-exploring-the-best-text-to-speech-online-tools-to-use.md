## Part 2\. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

 Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers.

That's why video translators play a crucial role in every person's life. If there is no video translator, the world will become dull.
