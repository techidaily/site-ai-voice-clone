 That’s all. We hope now you know how**auto translate for YouTube** works. With this feature, you can**translate YouTube video to English,** or any other language according to your needs. It’s easy and super helpful for watching content in any language.

## Part 2: Limitations of YouTube Auto Translate Feature

 Like all good things,**auto translate for YouTube captions** feature is not without its faults. Below are some of it’s limitations:

1. While YouTube is slowly rolling out the feature for all languages, automatic captions still don’t support many regional languages
2. If the video is over an hour in length, YouTube's automatic caption software fails to capture the dialogue in an efficient way.
3. If the video has a lower audio quality or the dialogue uses a specific word multiple times, it is hard to decipher for the auto-translate AI.
4. Long periods of silence at the beginning or end of the video can also throw off the software.
5. If a video has multiple speakers with overlapping dialogue, it can confuse the software and make errors in translation.

## Part 3: Virbo: A Powerful Tool That Translates Accurately

[Wondershare Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/app/video-translate) has been around for a while. You probably already know it because of its revolutionary feature of creating AI avatar videos.

### Why Choose Virbo?

 Most AI video translators refer only to subtitles for translation. They translate verbatim and leave out the audio lip-synching from the final product. Virbo is different because it utilizes the latest AI advancements to understand the context of a dialogue, giving you highly accurate and precise results. It also matches the lip-synching to give you synchronized talking videos in a different language. What’s more, you can also set Virbo to proofread the generated text before translation. This removes any unnecessary or repeated words, making your subtitles crisp and concise. You can also download translated subtitles as SRT or TXT files and use them the way you want.

### Language Support

Virbo currently supports translation in the following languages:

 English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, Indonesian, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Italian, Korean, Thai, Filipino, Bengali, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Croatian, Romanian, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Malay, Slovak, Danish, Tamil, Polish, Greek, Finnish, Burmese, Urdu
