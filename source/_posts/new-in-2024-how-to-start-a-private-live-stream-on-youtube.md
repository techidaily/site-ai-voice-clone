 AI (Artificial Intelligence) has become part and parcel of our lives these days. Communication is one of the industries that this revolutionary technology has dramatically impacted. Nowadays, you can harness the power of AI to create professional videos and audio narrations to pass your message effectively. So, in this post, we will help you find the best **real time AI voice changer** and some possible uses for this program. Let’s dig in!

## **Part 1\. How real time AI voice changers work**

 A**real time voice changer AI** is a program that has been extensively trained using deep machine learning algorithms to create a virtual clone of human voices. These programs work by creating a large data set of diverse audio clips, allowing them to analyze your live voice and transform it into your input prompt.

 Usually, AI voice changers use machine learning algorithms to transform live voices recorded using your microphone easily. However, sometimes, you may need to enter a text data prompt using speech-to-text AI voice cloning services. Whichever model you choose, the speech training model can take a few minutes or hours to clone your voice.

 But AI voice cloners don’t work independently. Instead, these tools allow you to make post-processing adjustments to make your AI voice sound how you want it. For example, you can make sound adjustments like pitch, tone, emotion, etc. Overall, the AI voice cloning process is pretty complex, although the process on your side may take just a few clicks.

Some AI voice changers also have voices that are ideal for video documentaries.

#### 3\. Accessibility
