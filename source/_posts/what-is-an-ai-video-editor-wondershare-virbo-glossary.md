**3\. How do I change the language in TikTok?**

 To change the language of your TikTok, perform the following instructions:

1. Tap the “Three Lines” from the top right corner of the Profile screen and proceed with the “Settings and Privacy” option.
2. Next, you will have to locate the “App Language” option and choose your preferred language for your TikTok app.

## **Conclusion**

 TikTok is one of the biggest modern-day social media platforms. If you are someone who’s looking to maximize the TikTok gains, then having a great**auto-translation tool** like Virbo will help you stay ahead of the curve.

 The world has become a global village, and everything is interconnected. However, language still largely remains the problem. Thankfully, the tools we have mentioned in this blog will allow you to push your message in almost any language in the world.
