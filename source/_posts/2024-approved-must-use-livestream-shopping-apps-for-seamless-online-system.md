![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg)

#### Step 3

 After you select a character, you will see their image on the right side of the page. This is where you can customize their appearance and voice settings. Below the character image, you will see an “Edit” button that allows you to change their hair, eyes, mouth, clothes, accessories, and background.

![translate-twitter-video-1.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-1.jpg)

## **Part 1\. Why Translate Twitter Video?**

 Twitter has a vast user base worldwide. It offers an unparalleled opportunity to connect with diverse audiences. But the language barrier often stands as a significant obstacle.****Translating Twitter videos** addresses this challenge head-on. By offering many benefits beyond mere language comprehension.

Here's some benefit of translating video:

* **Accessibility to diverse audiences**

 When you translate videos on Twitter, you're breaking down language barriers. So everyone, no matter their language, can understand your content. This means more people connect with you, opening to diverse communities worldwide.

 Translating videos helps you reach more people on Twitter. If your content speaks different languages, more viewers can engage with it. Making your message go further and have more impact.

* **Building a more inclusive online community**

 By translating your videos, you're making Twitter a more welcoming place for everyone. Regardless of their language. This builds a stronger community where diverse voices are valued and heard.

## **Part 2\. Are There Built-in Translation Features on Twitter for Video?**

 Twitter has limited features in terms of translation. Currently, Twitter only allows the translation of text within tweets. There are no built-in features for translating video content directly on the platform. But, you can enable closed captions to aid in understanding video content.

Here are the steps to turn on closed captions videos on Twitter:

* **Step 1.** Open the Twitter app or website and find the video tweet that you want to watch with closed captions. This tweet could be in your timeline or a user's profile.
* **Step 2.** Tap the video's thumbnail to play the video.
* **Step 3.** Tap on the three dots at the top right of the screen to bring up the video player controls.

![Twitter’s video playback](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-2.jpeg)

 However, closed captions on Twitter are not perfect. Not every video on Twitter shows this feature. That's why this feature is not a popular option for many users.

## **Part 3\. How to Translate Twitter Video With Twitter Translator Bots**

 Users must use external tools such as bot accounts and AI video translators to translate videos on Twitter. These tools can help translate video content on Twitter. Making it more accessible to diverse audiences. While****Twitter video translation** features are limited, alternative methods can overcome these language barriers.

* **Step 2.** Follow the Bot Account

 Once you've found a suitable translation bot account, they usually require you to follow them to receive the translations.

* **Step 3.** Tag the Bot Account

 When you find a video tweet you want to translate, reply to that tweet and tag the translation bot account. You can mention the bot account's username and request a translation.

* **Step 4.** Wait for Translation

 The translation bot account will automatically respond to your tweet with the translated text. Depending on the bot's processing time and availability, this may take a few moments.

* **Step 5.** Review the Translations

 Once you receive the translation, review it to ensure accuracy and readability. Remember that automated translations may not always be perfect. So, use your judgment to assess the quality of the translation.

 The spread of the internet has changed consumer purchasing habits in recent years. Now, social media platforms are the growing digital marketplaces for products. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend of online shopping, and people now prefer buying online. This digital shopping mode eliminates the struggle to leave physical spaces in their busy routines.

![live selling and how to perform](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-live-selling-in-todays-work-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. A Basic Preview To "Live Shopping"

**Livestream selling** or live shopping refers to live product demonstrations on digital platforms. The retailer or host has to introduce themselves, their store, and sale before describing products. They explain each detail of the products and their prices while holding them in a direct video call. During that, ensure that followers can see the product and interact through comments.

 Customers perceive it as a lively shopping experience instead of websites loading products. It creates a sense of connection as people feel like shopping in physical stores. As**live selling** has a core element of being in real time, people can question and know about the product. Compared with traditional shopping, one can place an order through links mentioned in the livestream.

### Is It Beneficial To Sell Live in This Digital Industry?

 Live selling is an emerging way to attract customers to shop on online marketplaces. According to[research](#:~:text=76%25%20of%20US%20adults%20shop,at%20least%20once%20per%20week.) , 76% of US adults prefer shopping online for clothes and groceries. It focuses on customers’ desire to know about products that generate sales. Thus, it proves beneficial in many terms, among which a few are elaborated below:

#### 1\. Engaging and Updating Communication

 Businesses can directly engage with a broader audience by entering the live selling industry. They get knowledge about current product trends to introduce similar things. Besides, this method eliminates the need to target customers in-store or via e-mails. Now, businesses can market their product and live sales simultaneously.

#### 2\. Reduced Return Rates and Customer Satisfaction

 Before live selling, people need to search for what they want by visiting the official sites of brands. Also, they scroll to read honest product reviews for the validity of products. With live selling, customers can view the products and ask questions during the live sessions. Therefore, it lowers the return rates to 40% while increasing customer satisfaction and trust.

#### 3\. Potential Growth and Virtual Demonstrations

 This online shopping mode has the potential to upscale your business. According to a survey, companies can see top-line growth upward of 25% through live selling.

As Gen Z and millennials are more attracted to live streaming, social media platforms would be ideal hosts. Many brands are integrating social media with e-commerce to cut the need for two separate apps.

### 2\. Real-Time Session With Host

 Upon choosing a suitable platform, a live video session is arranged. For that purpose, you need a host who should seem trustworthy and relatable to the product. There could be more than one person in the live sale to demonstrate products and share tips and benefits. Besides, the host needs to interact with the customers and share thoughts about the product.

### 3\. Points of Product or Video Content

 The main object of live selling is to sell products, but the best way is to create hype. In this regard, brands offer special discounts and giveaways valid only during live streams. It increases the tendency of customers to make purchases during the live sessions. The live session must be 20-30 minutes and include click-on links for easy buying.

### 2\. Pick an Appropriate Date and Time

 Another tip to consider is choosing the right time and date for the maximum viewers. In this regard, retailers should avoid a popular shopping period such as Black Friday.

Considering this perspective, sellers should bring something unique to the shopping stream. For this purpose, they can explain the product's benefits and use cases. Furthermore, they should keep their tone friendly and humorous for the targeted audience.
