## Part 4\. Troubleshooting Issues When Converting Video Voice to Text

 Creating clear and accurate transcripts is essential for professional settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls that can impact transcription quality:

Issue 1: Background Noise

**Solution:** Noisy recordings can cause problems with transcription accuracy. Luckily, many video editing programs have noise-reduction features. Running your audio through one of these before conversion can make a big difference.

Issue 2: Accents or Dialects

**Solution:** Most speech recognition software is good these days, but accents and dialects can still trip them up. Check your software’s settings for options to adjust the recognition model. Some programs even let you upload a sample of the speaker’s voice to improve accuracy.

Issue 3: Punctuation Errors

**Solution:** Some software offers built-in punctuation correction you can use. If unavailable, find a separate grammar tool after conversion. Always proofread the transcript yourself for any missing punctuation.

Issue 4: Overlapping Voices of Speakers

**Solution:** If the video has multiple speakers, try software that can differentiate voices. This includes interviews and panel discussions. You can always transcribe each speaker’s section if that's not an option. Then, add timestamps to identify speaker changes in the transcript.

![online meeting concept](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/convert-video-voice-to-text-17.jpg)

Issue 5: Inconsistent Transcription Format

**Solution:** Most video-to-text software allows you to format after the converter generates the transcript. You can adjust fonts, add paragraph breaks, and even format speaker identification within the program. Also, you can always export the transcript to a word processor for in-depth formatting.

 Videos may be used as a tool to grow an audience's loyalty, enhance conversions, or draw in new clients. It's a fantastic approach to increase brand recognition and customer loyalty. To learn how other companies have created explainer films, we advise viewing some of the greatest ones currently available. These 10 explainer video examples are ones we recently came across and would want to share with you. Let's think about these wonderful videos and why we love them without further ado.

### 1. [Microsoft Office 365](https://youtu.be/RH26Ncrvwsw)

![best-explainer-video-examples-microsoft.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-microsoft.jpg)

 Although Microsoft does not need an introduction, its services or products do. The full functionality of Office 365 is described in this video. We are aware that the simplicity of this video animation is precisely what we like about it. The explainer film made by the Microsoft team is the ideal example of what one should include.

 With the help of amazing characters, this 30-second animation showcases Microsoft Whiteboard's advantages and shows how to use it. The reason In a Nutshell is at the top of our list of the best animated explainer films is because they consistently provide the most aesthetically attractive videos.

### 2. [Making Teamwork Click](https://youtu.be/l-7awVpecvU)

![best-explainer-video-examples-teamwork.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-teamwork.jpg)

 You know why this is one of the finest explanation videos we've ever seen? the animated explainer backdrop. There is no question about the quality of the animation, but pay attention to how the music precisely reflects the development of the narrative and gives it a new depth without interfering with the narration.

 Each year, businesses produce tens of thousands of explainer films, some of which are excellent and some of which are among the greatest ever made. Making Teamwork Click is just one of them. The basic backdrop and figures used here wonderfully complement the animation, which keeps your focus on the app.

 Ahrefs is a collection of SEO tools. In terms of managing SEO, the video demonstrates how to utilize and benefit from the tool. An adorable and enjoyable animation goes horizontally to the right as the pieces in the Ahrefs explanation video leap up and down on the screen. Cool cinematography with a horizontal pan to the right, cute effects, and smooth transitions. There is creative typography on it.

 Ahrefs has effectively disproven the notion that a company's brand is too corporate for animated explainer films. This animated software demo film demonstrates that combining stylish transitions with educational material is a pretty smart concept. We believe that this video's straightforwardness makes the use of animation ideal for the message it is trying to express.

To help users understand how to redeem offers on the McDonald's app, a humorous, daring character-driven explainer video animation was produced. The basic backdrop and figures used here wonderfully complement the animation, which keeps your focus on the app.

 Since videos that make viewers feel something are quite popular, we had to include this one on our list. Videos that evoke emotion in the viewer tend to be very popular, which is why we had to have this video on our list.

We're certain that this is one of our greatest animated explainer films since it has a properly written narrative, a lively vocal, and eye-catching image.

 Your video marketing plan won't be the same after you comprehend the power of videos and can determine if a certain video is beneficial or not. Acknowledging your errors also helps.
