2. **Speech Recognition:** The AI system extracts the audio and converts it into text. In the case of only subtitle files, the systems will recognize the language of the uploaded SRT.
3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.

### Tip 2\. Properly Plan Your Livestream

 It won’t be a good impression if you make mistakes in real-time interaction with viewers. Thus, make sure to prepare yourself before going to a live stream. To plan appropriately, collect the data and make an outline or presentation. You can livestream according to outlines and present your products.

### Tip 3\. Gain Expertise in TikTok Features

 Becoming a proficient user of TikTok features would be a plus for you. The first feature is its “Enhance” mode, which presents beauty filters to improve your appearance. The flip camera helps show something in front during live without moving the camera away. You can also share your live stream and filter your comments in real-time using TikTok.

### Tip 4\. Check TikTok Analytics

 Having a huge number of followers is not enough. You should also analyze when most of your audience stays active for a greater reach. For this, TikTok Analytics helps to supervise the viewers’ activities during specific intervals. Besides, you can also survey viewers to better understand which time is preferable for the maximum audience.

### Tip 5\. Promote Your Broadcast

 TikTok live selling improves when you engage with a broad audience. You can try multiple ways to promote your livestream and get more viewers. One way is to share your live stream link on other platforms or directly text the people. The second method is that you can create a promotional video of the scheduled live event. Viewers can watch your video as a trailer of the event to hype their interest.
