Traditional methods involve manual coding and design, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

### 2\. Speed of Development

AI game generators can rapidly generate game content and prototypes, speeding up development.  
Traditional methods may require extensive coding, design, and testing, leading to longer development cycles.

### 3\. Creativity and Innovation

AI game generators can introduce novel and unexpected elements by analyzing existing game data and patterns.  
Traditional methods use human creativity to design characters, levels, and gameplay mechanics.

### 4\. Personalization and Dynamic Content

AI game generators enable dynamic and personalized experiences by generating content based on player interactions.  
Traditional methods provide static content that's designed and coded beforehand.

### 5\. Resource Constraints
