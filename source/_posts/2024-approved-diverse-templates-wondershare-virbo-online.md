![talk shop live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/is-talkshoplive-right-for-you-live-shop-pros-tips-before-you-start-1.jpg)

 The TalkShopLive studio app for brands and creators brings an array of broadcast and management tools to mobile. The platform boasts of enabling users to promote and sell their shows before and after going live. This means that you can create a shoppable and shareable video for promoting your show even before it goes live.

 You also get to do a whole range of other cool things with Talk Shop Live.

* **Customers:** Use the proprietary multi-embedded point-of-sale technology to purchase an item during a live show without interrupting the live shopping experience.

## Part 3: Should You Start Talkshoplive Live Shopping Event?

 TalkShopLive does more than just live streaming. Creators, hosts, and brands can broadcast live shows to demonstrate their products to viewers.

 Choosing TalkShopLive as your live shopping platform keeps you on the right track. In addition to getting access to a wider audience, you also become more competitive in the market. However, it can be time-consuming and expensive to live stream all the time. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) promises a simplified future for sellers and creators.

## Part 1: What Are Talking Stock Photos and What Can You Do With Them?

 Let’s answer the most pressing question on your mind first. What are talking photos? Talking photos, simply put, are photos brought to life with video and voice. No longer are your photos just images – they can now include voice along with motion. That is one of the several uses of generative artificial intelligence that’s taking the world by storm. With talking photos, not only do you have a memory as image, but you can have the memory with voice and video to make it more life-like. In some uses, this can be deeply comforting to us.

 **Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

 What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

#### 2.3: Unsplash

![unsplash talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-4.jpg)

 Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

#### 2.4: Pexels

 Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik

![freepik talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-7.jpg)
