## Part 1\. Notice to Readers: Difference of Translating or Transcribing in Tamil

 Translating and transcribing are two distinct processes. Each is crucial in its own right when it comes to**Tamil language translate to English** :

 Remember that Google Translate may not always produce the most accurate translations. It’s especially evident for complex sentences or specialized terminology.

### YouTube Video Translation

 YouTube offers a built-in feature for translating video titles and descriptions. It can also generate subtitles in many languages, including languages from English to Tamil. Here’s how you can use it:

* **Step 1** : Upload your video to YouTube and navigate to the video’s editing page. Click the**Subtitles/CC** tab.
