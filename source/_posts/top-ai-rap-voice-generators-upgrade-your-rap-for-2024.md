The translation should be natural while avoiding any awkward encounters. Moreover, the tone and writing style should be consistent throughout the document.

6. **Legal and Ethical Boundaries:**  Upholding legal and ethical boundaries is important in all documents. If the video contains any medical records, it is essential to keep them confidential. In case of sensitive information, a translator must follow legal and ethical considerations.
7. **Requirements and Review:**  To achieve perfection, try finding a native translator for proofreading. The translator should follow any specific instructions provided by the client. This covers word count, file format, or reference materials. Besides, deadlines should be followed in handling translation to clients. Through the process, the translator must uphold communication with the client.
