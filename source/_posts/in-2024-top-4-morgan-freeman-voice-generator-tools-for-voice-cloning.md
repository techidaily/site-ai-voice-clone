## Part 1: How Many English Accents are Available All Over The World

 English has become one of the most commonly recognized languages around the world. Many countries across the globe speak English as a first or second language. The diversity of English language accents lies specifically in this fact. This is also proof of the language’s adaptability and rich cultural history.

 Assigning an exact number to the English accents spoken globally is challenging. Accents vary greatly with regions. Sometimes even the same city can produce multiple accents of the same language.

## Part 2: What Are The Reasons Behind Different English Accents

 Several factors contribute to the incredible diversity found in the English language. A range of features can influence accents, some of which include the following:

### 1\. Migration, Travel, and Settlements

 Throughout history, the world has seen many languages spread across the world. Travel has always been one of the primary reasons. Isolated communities often develop distinct accents due to limited interactions. More commonly, English-speaking populations have migrated and settled in various regions, blending the local language and native English accents. Due to this mixing, new and unique accents emerge.

### 2\. Colonization and Imperialism

 The British Empire's expansion era resulted in several colonial settlements. As a result, English was spread to numerous territories and far-off places in the world. The amalgamation of English with local languages and dialects gave rise to unique accents such as Indian and African English.

### 3\. Media and Entertainment

 Media has always been a powerful communication and a great way to spread your word. People often copy speech patterns observed in mainstream media and entertainment. These include movies, TV shows, and music. This can lead to the development of certain distinct accents and dialects. This particularly occurs in regions that have high media exposure.

### 4\. Education and Socioeconomic Factors

 Certain accents have been associated with distinct socioeconomic factors. Higher levels of education are often associated with more standardized and prestigious accents. Other influences such as occupation, social identity, and community also play a key role in determining the varying accents of individuals.

### 5\. Linguistic Drifts and Age

 Linguistic drift is a natural process that helps languages evolve. Like most languages, English has also undergone linguistic drift. This phenomenon has caused notable changes in various language features. These changes can be of phonological and grammatical nature.

#### Step 3\. Perform Other Edits to Video

After selecting the avatar and voiceover for the video, you can perform other edits as well. Change the background of the video or add music in the background according to your choice. If you want to display the subtitles across the video, enable the "**Subtitle**" option. Furthermore, for more advanced settings in your video, you can define a proper **"Layout**" or add stickers and edit text style on the top toolbar.

#### Step 1\. Start By Importing Your PPT File

After launching Wondershare Virbo on your desktop, continue to select the "**Create Video**" button. As this opens a pop-up, select the "**Import PPT**" option on the bottom-left to add your PowerPoint file.

Choose Import PPT

#### Step 2\. Add Avatars and Voiceover To the PPT Video

As you’ve imported your PPT file successfully, define whether you want to extract your script from the file or not. Click **"Create Video"** to redirect to the next window, which outlines the PowerPoint file as a video.

![import ppt](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/guide/windows/powerpoint-to-video-3.jpg)

Import PPT

Here, you need to define a proper avatar according to your video, which can be done using the "**Avatars**" button on the top toolbar.

![select avatar for ppt video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/guide/windows/powerpoint-to-video-4.jpg)

Select Avatars

Consequently, you need to add a proper voiceover that will assist you in explaining the PowerPoint file within the video. For that, lead to the "**Text Script"** or "**Audio Upload"** section to add the appropriate voiceover. Define your voice from the available list and set its parameters, or upload your pre-recorded voice to add along with the avatar.

Furthermore, for more advanced settings in your video, you can define a proper **"Layout**" or add stickers and edit text style on the top toolbar.
