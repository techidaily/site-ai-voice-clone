## Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the**online live shopping** success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

 A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

 Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

 One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

 As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

Additionally, multilingual Text-to-Speech comes with a convolutional encoder with parameters that are language-specific. There are also some interactive demos that introduce code-switching abilities and provide multilingual training on the model.

### 6\. [One-Shot Voice Cloning CMsmartvoice](https://github.com/CMsmartvoice/One-Shot-Voice-Cloning)

One-shot voice cloning with Unet-TTS features a powerful speaker and style transfer capabilities. The repository generates text sounds with provided inferencing code and pre-training models. Its model training focuses on neutral emotion to avoid strong emotional speech. Also, it addresses the challenges of out-of-domain style using the Unet network and AdaIN layer.

Users are not required to use reference speech if they plan to do one-shot voice cloning. Also, the requirement to manually enter statistics of duration is no longer essential. Only Linux users can install it with the correct TensorFlow and TensorFlow-addons versions.

### 7\. [Voice-Synthesis (smoke-trees)](https://github.com/smoke-trees/Voice-synthesis)

This approach creates a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. Then, it uses this audio for text-to-speech synthesis. SV2TTS excels with deep learning and uses a speaker encoder, synthesizer, and voice coder. It clones voices in real time with zero-shot learning. The repository identifies voices, and the synthesizer generates Mel-spectrograms from the text. Finally, the vocoder turns them into lifelike waveforms.

All you need to do is feed this repository your voice sample or custom voice, and it can synthesize a clone of it for you. You can also use a microphone to input your text commands through speech. There are also instructions given if you want to work with your own models on different datasets and language mediums.

### 8\. [VoiceSmith (dunky11)](https://github.com/dunky11/voicesmith)

VoiceSmith is an easy-to-use repository requiring no coding experience. It fine-tunes a pipeline based on Delightful TTS and UnivNet for single or many speakers. Users can opt from a proprietary 5000 speaker dataset with automatic text normalization. Windows and Linux are supported, and an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is for faster training. Docker is essential for seamless operation for users exploring **real-time voice cloning online**.

* Install Requirements:

A RAM of less than 8GB may not work well with it, so it’s better to use at least 8GB RAM. To use this repository on Linux, you are advised to install Docker Engine. Users also get to play around with an emotional 60-speaker dataset-trained model.

### 9\. [Voice Cloning App by BenAAndrew](https://github.com/BenAAndrew/Voice-Cloning-App)

## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

![Set a timer to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-8.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Start the recording

 Then click “Start recording” to record the video with the timer on.
