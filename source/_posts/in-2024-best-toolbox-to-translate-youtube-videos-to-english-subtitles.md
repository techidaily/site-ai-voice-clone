## Part 2: Reliable Tips to Create the Most Engaging YouTube Shorts Videos

 Although the AI tools mentioned above can help you generate YouTube Shorts according to your need, they cannot entirely replace human creativity. Are you looking to improve the quality of your YouTube Shorts? Here are a few tips that may come in handy in making your videos more entertaining.

### 1\. Keep it Short

 Remember, these short videos on YouTube are called “YouTube Shorts” for a reason. It is important to keep your content minimal and to the point. Your key focus should be on content delivery and making your videos as concise as possible.

 Moreover, you should value your viewer’s time as well. Studies also suggest that the attention span of users is gradually decreasing. So it is a good practice to determine the length of the video beforehand.

### 2\. Customize Thumbnails

 Thumbnails play an important role in the engagement of your video. It is how viewers decide if they want to click on your video or not. It is advisable to create custom thumbnails for your YouTube Shorts. Design a thumbnail that complements your content. Incorporate catchy and attention-grabbing elements to increase views.

### 3\. Consistency is Key

 It is important to remain consistent across your Shorts videos. Maintaining a consistent style and tone is a key element. It helps build a recognizable brand identity. Making a regular posting schedule is also a key factor on the YouTube platform. Sticking to a routine is always helpful whether you choose to upload weekly, bi-weekly, or another interval.

### 4\. Dynamic and Appealing Aesthetics

 Focusing on the visuals of your Shorts can enhance viewer engagement and make your content stand out. Aesthetically pleasing visuals capture viewers' attention. Dynamic aesthetics maintain their interest throughout the video. Unique and engaging elements also make your videos more memorable.

### 5\. Optimize the Viewing Options

 If you wish to boost engagement on your YouTube Shorts, catering to your viewer’s varying needs is imperative. Keep in mind the platforms that users will be viewing the video on. Most users view Shorts on their mobile phones. Hence, ensure your videos are optimized for vertical viewing. It also helps to make them easily navigable on small screens.

## Wrapping Up

 As AI continues to transform our lives, these**AI short video generator** tools prove how much has changed in the world of content creation. You can embrace the power of these tools for multiple purposes. From generating dynamic visuals to enabling diversity, you can do it all. With the prowess of AI, the future of content creation certainly appears boundless.

![talking photo banner](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What Are Talking Stock Photos and What Can You Do With Them?

 Let’s answer the most pressing question on your mind first. What are talking photos? Talking photos, simply put, are photos brought to life with video and voice. No longer are your photos just images – they can now include voice along with motion. That is one of the several uses of generative artificial intelligence that’s taking the world by storm. With talking photos, not only do you have a memory as image, but you can have the memory with voice and video to make it more life-like. In some uses, this can be deeply comforting to us.

#### 1.1: Uses of Talking Photos

 What can talking photos be used for? Talking photos can be used for fun as well as for interactive education. Here are some uses of talking photos, in a gist:

* An interactive and more engaging learning experience for children.
* Convey emotions better.
* Send personalized messages with voice!
* Capture viewer attention right from the start.
* Create memories by adding voice to photos for a more vivid memory experience!
* Your social media shares can become that much more interesting and engaging.

 “Okay, I’m sold on talking photos! Where can I get them?”

 Glad you asked! We have collated a repository of 6 portals that offer quality talking stock photos and talking stock images that you can choose and use!

 **Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

 What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

 What self-respecting journalist or newsreader does not know about Getty Images? Getty has a repertoire of over 7,935,000 high-quality talking photos for you to choose from. That all but guarantees that you will be able to find the ones you want and like.

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

#### 2.3: Unsplash

![unsplash talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-4.jpg)

 Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

#### 2.4: Pexels

![pexels talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-5.jpg)

#### 2.5: Pixabay

![pixabay talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-6.jpg)

 Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik

![freepik talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-7.jpg)
