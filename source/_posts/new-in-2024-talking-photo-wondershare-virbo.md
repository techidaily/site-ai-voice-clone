##### Step 2 Generate the Script

 Start writing your script to generate lifelike voices. However, if you want to write a script yourself, press “Enter.” In contrast, if you want to get an AI-generated script, choose the “Ask AI to Write” option.

Finally, choose the “Add to Script” option to use it for your videos.
