### Limitations

Despite how many features Descript offers, there are still some limitations to using this tool. In the following section, we have highlighted some of these:

* Descript doesn't have a mobile app for editing videos. Many users find it convenient to record and edit content on a smartphone rather than on a desktop.
* This tool can sometimes be a bit slow, especially on a MacBook. While this is common for video editing tools, it can be irritating while making videos.
* While you can find various templates within the Descript library, the options are not flexible. Users are unable to find different options to choose template themes.
* Although the transcription quality is generally great, it always needs some post-editing. Descript does not automatically update all changes of a word after fixing it in the transcript.

### Pricing Plans

The pricing plan of Descript is very reasonable for content creators and provides valuable features with each plan. No matter if you are a beginner or a professional, the **Descript overdub** feature will help you with content creation tasks:

| Pricing Plan | Price         |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Basic        | $12 per month |
| Pro          | $24 per month |
