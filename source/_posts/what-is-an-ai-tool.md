## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

![Set a timer to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-8.jpg)

Let’s explore the easy steps to see magic and give life to your video scripts:

##### Step 1 Create an Audio Project

 First, visit the official website of Descript, download the tool, and open it on your devices. On the tool's dashboard, head to the left toolbar and click the "Projects" tab. On the upcoming window, tap on the “New” button. Now, you’ll find a dropdown menu; choose “Audio Project” among the available features. Then, you’ll find a new screen to do your audio projects.

##### Step 2 Generate the Script

 Start writing your script to generate lifelike voices. However, if you want to write a script yourself, press “Enter.” In contrast, if you want to get an AI-generated script, choose the “Ask AI to Write” option.

##### Step 3 Employ AI to Polish Your Script

 After clicking this button, a dialog box will appear on the screen. Now, write what you want AI to do in the prompt box and select the “Enter” key. You can specify your output of a whole script, an outline, or brainstorming ideas for your content. Moreover, you can ask AI to refine the result to get the required answer. Finally, choose the “Add to Script” option to use it for your videos.

##### Step 4 Add Speaker to Your Project

 In the next step, the chosen script will appear on the screen. Now, hit the “Add Speaker” button to select the speaker you want to produce voices for your videos. You can opt for the “Browse Stock AI Speakers” to choose among the speakers offered by the tool. Later, navigate to the bottom of the screen and tap on the “Play” icon to preview the recording.
