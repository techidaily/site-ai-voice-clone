 In multi-person conversation photos, accurately synchronizing lip movements poses a complex challenge. Coordinating lip movements and distinguishing speakers is challenging, especially in dynamic group settings with diverse expressions and speech patterns.

### ● **Technical Limitations**

 Real-time lip-syncing and audio processing require a lot of computer power. Handling large amounts of data while keeping quality needs efficient algorithms. Additionally, it's hard to balance performance and resources in talking photo technology.

### ● **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**

 Besides technical hurdles, ethical and privacy issues arise with talking photo technology. Manipulating visual and auditory content raises concerns about misinformation, privacy breaches, and potential misuse of digital media.
