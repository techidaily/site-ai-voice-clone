## Part 1: How Text-to-Video AI Generators Work to Create Videos

 Text-to-video AI generators produce videos in an instant way. The first step involves the entering of input data. This data acts as a set of instructions, descriptions, characters, keywords, and other required details.

 Afterward, semantic understanding is conducted through NLP and NER models. Such models extract information from the input text, such as characters, locations, dialogues, etc. This step is significant as it helps produce a relevant visual video for the user.

 Once done, the AI tool starts planning the video scenes through the extracted information. While creating the structure of the video, the tool selects relevant objects, backgrounds, transitions, graphics, and overlays. Afterward, the AI tool adds visual elements and effects to make a creative video. If the video is animated, the tool adds a sense of motion to the objects, backgrounds, and characters.

 Moreover, human emotion is also added according to the script's demand. If there are dialogues between the characters, the AI tool will use its TTS engine to produce voiceovers. During this process, relevant background music and sound effects are added to ensure the captivity of the video. Once the visual and audio data is generated, the tool merges each scene smartly.

 This rendering process also includes lip-syncing, transitions, and overall timing. Some AI tools also introduce quality control techniques to eliminate errors from the video. You can also give respective feedback to refine the results. The final stage produces a complete video in the required file format. Afterward, you can add further customization and share the video on multiple platforms.

### 2\. Set your objectives for TikTok Live

 When it comes to going live on TikTok, you also need to set your objectives. TikTok Live Studio provides many features that you can leverage. Hence, by planning your actions, you can make the best out of going live on TikTok

 For example, before your stream starts, ask yourself, what are your objectives? Do you want more views, more people engaged, more conversations, monetization? Once you have the goal in mind, then you can leverage TikTok Live Studio and make the most return out of your effective live session.

### 3\. Promote your live beforehand

 Before you go live using TikTok Live Studio, you need to promote your life. It is important to build up anticipation before actually going live on the platform. Hence, when you announce that you are going live and also tease what is going to be in the video, you improve your chances of getting more viewers to join, especially if you have an audience already.

 One of the best ways to promote is simply to make an engaging TikTok that only teases the content of your upcoming live session, sparking the curiosity factor amongst the potential viewers.

### 4\. Timing matters the most

 The right time when you push out your content is what matters the most. The same is true with YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and most other platforms. With TikTok, you must understand where your audience is mostly active in

 How do you find that? Well, you need to understand your audience deeply and when they are mostly active. For example, your audience could be active on TikTok on a certain time and that’s where pushing your livestream will get the most results.

### 5\. Take care of technical aspects

## Live Commerce Next Chapter: Can AI Unlock Its True Potential?

 The world of e-commerce has gone through a tremendous transformation in the recent past, with terms like **live commerce** , live streaming, live shopping, and live chat becoming a norm. S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

 The use of live commerce features has made significant impacts on business industries. From collaboration with influencers to engaging viewers in consultation, the following brands have transformed their engagement through live online shopping:

### 1\. Michael Kors: Fashionable Collaboration Boosts Engagement

**Lessons Drawn:** Collaborations with relatable influencers can drive significant engagement and sales. The live stream event also demonstrated the importance of interactive elements like styling tips and real-time Q&A in fostering connections and building trust with customers.

### 2\. Sephora: Beauty Unboxed with Community Building

**Lessons Drawn:** Brands can create a powerful formula for success by combining education, entertainment, and community building. Live streaming e commerce provides valuable product information and real-time interactions that can be used to foster loyalty while building lasting communities.

### 3\. Nike: Live Workouts Drive Brand Advocacy

 Nike partnered with professional athletes and trainers to host live workout sessions on their app. The live commerce event allowed viewers to participate in the workouts at home, purchase featured Nike apparel and equipment, and interact with other users.
