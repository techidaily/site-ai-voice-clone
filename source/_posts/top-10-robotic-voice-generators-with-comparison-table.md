![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-1.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-1.jpg)

#### Step 2

 Once you are on the online demo page, you will see a list of characters on the left side of the page. These are the avatars that you can choose from to create your funny talking avatar. You can browse the characters by category, such as animals, celebrities, cartoons, etc. You can also search for a specific character by typing their name in the search box at the top of the list. For example, if you want to create a funny talking avatar of Donald Trump, you can type “Trump” in the search box and select his character from the list.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg)

#### Step 3

 After you select a character, you will see their image on the right side of the page. This is where you can customize their appearance and voice settings. Below the character image, you will see an “Edit” button that allows you to change their hair, eyes, mouth, clothes, accessories, and background. You can click on this button and use the sliders and buttons to adjust these features as you like.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg)
