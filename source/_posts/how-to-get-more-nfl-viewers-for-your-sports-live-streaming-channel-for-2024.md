* This tool can sometimes be a bit slow, especially on a MacBook. While this is common for video editing tools, it can be irritating while making videos.
* While you can find various templates within the Descript library, the options are not flexible. Users are unable to find different options to choose template themes.
* Although the transcription quality is generally great, it always needs some post-editing. Descript does not automatically update all changes of a word after fixing it in the transcript.
