## Part 2: Why are Subtitles Important in Video Content?

 Subtitles are important for video content, as they enhance the overall experience. They act as a helping aid in multiple situations, environments, and more. This section of the reading elaborates on the advantages of subtitles below:

1. **Inclusivity and Accessibility:** Primarily, subtitles make content available to a broader audience. Whether anyone is facing a hearing loss or hearing impairment, they can still read. In scenes where non-native audiences cannot understand speech, they are a savior. In video lectures or tutorials, subtitles enhance the audience's comprehension.
2. **Multilingual Translation:** An increased understanding of disabled audiences’ aids in multilingual support. When you generate subtitles for a video, you can transform it into other languages. Later, you can use text-to-speech converters to generate multilingual speech.
3. **Improved SEO Performance:** You must have been aware of SEO and its ranking policies. Subtitles double your video’s SEO ranking and overall performance. Hence, adding subtitles can help the audience find your video on top search results. This is a valuable marketing tactic for content creators and brands working online.
4. **Noise-Sensitive Environments:** As lives become demanding, the time of leisure limits every day. Students and professionals entertain themselves during their travel time. However, these environments, like traffic, libraries, and offices, are noise-sensitive. This is where subtitles help with content comprehension when you cannot hear.
5. **Improved Learning:** People try to learn multiple languages via video content. Subtitles help them with better comprehension by engaging both audio and visual senses. The audience also has a visual representation of spoken language for quick learning. They also clarify any misunderstandings of dialogues and maintain consistency.
6. **Legal Requirements:** In some regions, adding subtitles is a legal requirement. For instance, communist nations make them compulsory for their disabled audience. Thus, instead of hiring editors or translators, video speech-to-text converters online are preferable.

## Part 3: How Well Has AI Adapted to Converting Video Content into Text?

 In the past, the procedure to**translate video audio to text**  was quite complex. It changed with the advancement of automatic speech recognition and natural language processing. The integration of these ASRs and NLPs made AI technology more adaptable. Here is an extensive review of how AI has revolutionized to convert video audio to text:

**3\. Multilingual Support**

 These AI tools contain vast training data and NLP systems, making their scope diverse. They can analyze and recognize multiple languages and generate relevant subtitles. The integration of these tools in global applications helps with enhanced utility. Moreover, content creators can translate and upload their videos on social platforms.

 The wonders of AI technology in YouTube video voice to text converters online don't stop there. With the AI's vast training data and internet access, users can make customizations. For instance, if you're working in the marketing industry, you can set it to use marketing jargon. This feature is handy for industries like healthcare, legal, and IT.

**5\. Multiple Speech Recognition**

 With the introduction of continuous advancements, speech transcribers also upgraded. In podcasts or recordings where there are multiple speakers, they can still do the job. The AI can detect multiple speakers as separate speeches and transcribe them simultaneously.

**6\. Diverse Integrations**

 Developers and programmers can integrate this AI technology into other platforms or tools. This enhances the applications of software and improves its performance.

 Artificial Intelligence or AI has revolutionized video creation, making it faster and easier for creators to produce a video within minutes. Through[algorithms and neural networks](https://www.datatobiz.com/blog/smart-video-generation-from-text/) , you can now**generate videos from text** .

 OpenAI's Sora, for example, has been a hot topic for its ability to create ultra-realistic videos from text. This technology has the potential to transform the way we approach content creation across numerous industries. Creators of all backgrounds and skill levels can create professional-looking content with minimal effort.

 If you are interested in this new technology, this article will provide you with insights and practical steps on**how to create videos from text** .

## Part 1\. How To Use OpenAI’s Sora Video Generator

 While Sora is the most advanced and leading video-to-text AI generator by far, it's currently only accessible to "red team" researchers and not available to the public. OpenAI has not yet specified a public release date for Sora, though it is likely to be sometime in 2024.

 Once it’s available to use for the public, you can use Sora on their[official website](https://openai.com/sora) . Follow these steps on**how to use OpenAI’s Sora video generator** :

* **Step 1:** Write the prompt

 You will need to start providing a detailed written prompt outlining the content you wish to see in your video. This prompt could include descriptions of scenes or any specific visual elements you envision.

* **Step 2:** Generate the AI video (max. 1 minute)

 After submitting your written prompt, Sora's AI model will analyze and interpret your text, generating a video that encapsulates the essence of your prompt. The resulting video will last no longer than one minute.

* **Step 3:** How to create longer videos

 For those who want to produce longer videos, you may need to add additional details or scenes and synchronize them with the desired frame count to create a cohesive narrative.

## Part 2\. Sora Alternative: How To Create Video From Text

 If you're seeking an alternative to Sora for**creating videos from text** , you can try using invideo.io. Invideo.io presents itself as an effective text-to-video generator tool designed to transform textual content effortlessly into video.

InVideo.io features:

* Accessibility through mobile apps for convenient video creation on the go
* Live chat support
* Collaboration tools that facilitate teamwork and shared project management
* An extensive library boasting a diverse collection of videos, stock photos, and music tracks

 How to**create video from text** with ease:

* **Step 1:** Go to the invidio.io website and create an account.

 To**create videos from text** with invideo AI, you'll need to create an account on its[website](https://invideo.io/) . Once you are signed in, access its text-to-video AI tool to begin creating your videos.

![create video from text with invideo AI.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/how-to-generate-videos-from-text-2.jpg)

* **Step 2:** Input the text prompt.

 Once you are on the interface, you can input your prompt. Give clear and detailed instructions for optimal results, and click the "Generate a video" button to proceed.

For example, we will use this prompt to generate the video:

 _A realistic video showcasing the evolution of urban landscapes from the 20th century to the present day, highlighting architectural styles, infrastructure advancements, and societal changes. Incorporate visuals of iconic buildings, city skylines, transportation systems, and cultural landmarks to illustrate the transformation over time._

## Part 3\. Tips for Writing Prompts To Generate Videos From Text

 The key to**creating AI videos from text** is a good prompt. Unlike text-to-image generators, creating video prompts needs greater detail and clarity. With a good prompt, you can effectively guide the AI model in understanding the desired visual elements, narrative structure, and emotional context of the video.

 Here, we list a few tips to create good prompts for generating videos from text:

1. **Provide context**

 When crafting your AI video prompt, include specific information such as desired style, target audience, intended platform for posting (e.g., YouTube), and preferred tone (e.g., casual or formal). You can also indicate if you want high-definition video, like 4K videos.

1. **Be clear and specific**

 Although providing details is important, avoid unnecessary things that could confuse AI text-to-video generators. Keep your prompt clear and focused to ensure the AI understands your instructions accurately.

1. **Use descriptive language**

 Given that the AI will transform your text into videos, use descriptive language to depict characters, settings, actions, and objects vividly. This will help the AI create a more accurate representation of your vision.

1. **Incorporate keywords**

 Some AI video prompt platforms may support the use of tags or keywords to help generate video according to our intent. Use these keywords to influence the AI's output effectively.

1. **Structure the prompt effectively**

 Organize your prompt in a logical manner to ensure clarity and coherence. Start with an introductory sentence that summarizes the main idea or theme of the video. Then, break down the key elements or scenes you want to include.

 Moreover, pay attention to scene transitions. In case you need multiple scenes, make sure they transition smoothly to maintain a coherent flow when**generating videos from text** .

## Part 4\. How To Convert Video to Text Easily with Video-to-Text Tool

 To elevate your video further, you can convert your video to text easily using[Wondershare Virbo’s Video Translator](https://virbo.wondershare.com/video-translation.html) tool, which functions as a reliable video-to-text generator.
