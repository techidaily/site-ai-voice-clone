 Going anywhere without preparation is always a disaster; the same goes for creating videos. You should make a rough outline with a concise subject. The video's intent should be clear so you can deliver it to the right audience. Also, pre-planning can help to craft a professional script and shoot videos accordingly.

#### 2\. Adjust Lighting for a Better View

 Lighting plays a pivotal role in shooting videos. So, you should focus on lighting adjustments and clarity. Also, you need to avoid overexposure, harsh shadows, and lousy lighting resources. You can also use natural light that doesn’t throw shadows.

#### 3\. Improve Audio Quality

 Undoubtedly, audio is half of your content and delivers your message to the audience. Therefore, low audio quality is unacceptable when creating professional**talking head videos.** Using a camera microphone might not be a good choice as it doesn’t provide high quality. Therefore, you can use a lapel or boom mic to enhance voice quality.

#### 4\. Make Your Setup Decent
