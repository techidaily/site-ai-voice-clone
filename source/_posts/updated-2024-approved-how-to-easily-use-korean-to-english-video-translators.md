If you have seen magic/sorcery/ wizardry-themed movies, you might have come across the idea of moving photos or motion photos where photo frames are shown to have motion pictures. In real life, you have what’s called Live Photos by Apple, a technology that captures a couple of seconds' worth of motion. These are essentially just GIFs. But this is 2024, and today, we introduce you to talking photos or talking stock images. Literally, photos that speak. What! Read more about it below!

![talking photo banner](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What Are Talking Stock Photos and What Can You Do With Them?

 Let’s answer the most pressing question on your mind first. What are talking photos? Talking photos, simply put, are photos brought to life with video and voice. No longer are your photos just images – they can now include voice along with motion. That is one of the several uses of generative artificial intelligence that’s taking the world by storm. With talking photos, not only do you have a memory as image, but you can have the memory with voice and video to make it more life-like. In some uses, this can be deeply comforting to us.

#### 1.1: Uses of Talking Photos

 What can talking photos be used for? Talking photos can be used for fun as well as for interactive education. Here are some uses of talking photos, in a gist:

* An interactive and more engaging learning experience for children.
* Convey emotions better.
* Send personalized messages with voice!
* Capture viewer attention right from the start.
* Create memories by adding voice to photos for a more vivid memory experience!

 **Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

 What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

#### 2.3: Unsplash

![unsplash talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-4.jpg)

 Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images.

 Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik

![freepik talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-7.jpg)
