## Part 3\. Tips for Writing Prompts To Generate Videos From Text

 The key to**creating AI videos from text** is a good prompt. Unlike text-to-image generators, creating video prompts needs greater detail and clarity. With a good prompt, you can effectively guide the AI model in understanding the desired visual elements, narrative structure, and emotional context of the video.

 Here, we list a few tips to create good prompts for generating videos from text:

1. **Provide context**

 When crafting your AI video prompt, include specific information such as desired style, target audience, intended platform for posting (e.g., YouTube), and preferred tone (e.g., casual or formal). You can also indicate if you want high-definition video, like 4K videos.

1. **Be clear and specific**

 Although providing details is important, avoid unnecessary things that could confuse AI text-to-video generators. Keep your prompt clear and focused to ensure the AI understands your instructions accurately.

1. **Use descriptive language**

 Given that the AI will transform your text into videos, use descriptive language to depict characters, settings, actions, and objects vividly. This will help the AI create a more accurate representation of your vision.

1. **Incorporate keywords**

 Some AI video prompt platforms may support the use of tags or keywords to help generate video according to our intent. Use these keywords to influence the AI's output effectively.

1. **Structure the prompt effectively**

 Organize your prompt in a logical manner to ensure clarity and coherence. Start with an introductory sentence that summarizes the main idea or theme of the video. Then, break down the key elements or scenes you want to include.

 Moreover, pay attention to scene transitions. In case you need multiple scenes, make sure they transition smoothly to maintain a coherent flow when**generating videos from text** .

![twitch stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/build-your-ai-twitch-streamer-with-animated-avatars-1.jpg)

The AI avatar in Twitch can be manifested in several ways:

1. **Virtual AI Streamers** : An animated 2D or 3D avatar is controlled by an AI program to play games or respond to chat messages in real-time. The avatar can engage in basic conversations either in text messages or synthesized voice. Common examples include AtheneLive and Neuro-sama.
2. **AI-Powered Stream Assistants:** The A avatar acts as a co-host or helper alongside a human streamer. They can analyze chat messages and offer insights, play music, generate live graphs, respond to cues, and add overlays to enhance the stream.
