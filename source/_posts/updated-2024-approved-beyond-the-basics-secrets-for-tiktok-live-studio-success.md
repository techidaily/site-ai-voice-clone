 When starting**live shopping at Shopee** , it is essential to follow the rules to have a good time. This means you have to do what Shopee says when you're selling things or buying them on the platform. Let’s explore these[guidelines](https://seller.shopee.com.my/edu/article/1326) to ensure a better shopping experience:

1. You can only add up to 500 products to the orange bag during one livestream.
2. Sellers can't use phrases like “Add to Orange Bag” or “Send PM” to share links. It is prohibited during the stream or on social media outside the Shopee app.
3. If you have multiple shops, each shop needs its livestream. Also, ensure the items you promote fit within the live stream frame.
4. Do not upload content with sensitive information, harassment, or cyberbullying.
5. Users can't use music they don't own the rights to during their live shopping. Instead, you should use music that is free for anyone to use.
6. You can rearrange the products and edit details like price discounts before you go live.

## Part 3\. The Simple Guide to Using the Live Shopping Service of Shopee
