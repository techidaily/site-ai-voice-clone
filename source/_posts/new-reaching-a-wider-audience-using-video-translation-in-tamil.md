## Part 1\. Notice to Readers: Difference of Translating or Transcribing in Tamil

 Translating and transcribing are two distinct processes. Each is crucial in its own right when it comes to**Tamil language translate to English** :

### Meaning

 Translating is converting the meaning of spoken words or written text from one language to another, like English convert to Tamil meaning. It ensures that the essence and intent remain intact. Transcribing focuses on converting spoken words into written text. It captures the dialogue or narration without considering the nuances of translation.

### Context

 Translation takes into account the broader context of the content. It often factors in cultural references and idiomatic expressions. It also takes into account societal norms to convey the message. Transcription deals with capturing the spoken words. It doesn’t delve into the context or cultural nuances.

### Nuances

 Translation requires knowing both languages involved. It allows you to convey the nuances of the original content. Transcription focuses more on capturing the spoken words. It often doesn’t consider the linguistic nuances or cultural context.

### Google Translate

 Google Translate is a well-known tool for translating text from one language to another, such as**English to Tamil translation** . Here’s how you can use it for basic translation:

* **Step 1** : Visit the Google Translate website or open the Google Translate app. Select the input and output languages (e.g., English to Tamil).

![video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg)

* **Step 2** : Type or paste the text you want to translate into the provided box. Google Translate will instantly translate the text into Tamil.

 Remember that Google Translate may not always produce the most accurate translations. It’s especially evident for complex sentences or specialized terminology.

### YouTube Video Translation

 YouTube offers a built-in feature for translating video titles and descriptions. It can also generate subtitles in many languages, including languages from English to Tamil. Here’s how you can use it:

* **Step 1** : Upload your video to YouTube and navigate to the video’s editing page. Click the**Subtitles/CC** tab.
* **Step 2** : Select the language you want to translate your subtitles into (e.g., Tamil). YouTube will automatically generate machine-translated subtitles.
* **Step 3** : Review and edit the translated subtitles to ensure accuracy and coherence.

**YouTube’s video translation in Tamil** feature can be helpful at times. But, it may not capture the nuances or cultural context accurately. Manual editing is often required to refine the translations. This is important to ensure they align with the original video content.

### **Select the Right Animation Style and Tools:**

 After the script has been polished and completed, style and formatting are needed. This phase also aids in giving you a general idea of the character that will appear in the video, the color schemes that will be used, the tone, etc. Start by gathering supporting materials for the final film, such as images, videos, and other elements. Referencing your storyboard and keeping a list of the materials your video needs is a smart idea. Animated characters, icons, and images are examples of assets.

 Make the spectator feel as if they are a part of the universe you have created. This is a challenging step since you must coordinate all the animations to get the ideal outcome! Along with speech and other significant notes, they often contain instructions for camera angles, tips and changes for lighting, and transitions between scenes.

### **Choose an Appropriate Voice-Over or Narration:**

 Like the majority of experienced writers, brilliant marketers start their videos with voice-over narrations. It's crucial to remember that before the animation process can begin, the voice-over must be recorded.

 The majority of video editing programs provide you access to stock music that you may use in your productions. As an alternative, you may search through a variety of websites with royalty-free music to locate the ideal song for your film.

## **Part 2: The Operation Procedure to Create Animated Explainer Videos**

 Some people may believe that making animated explanation films is simple. The misunderstanding is mostly caused by how brief and uncomplicated many animated videos on social media are. From consulting with customers, selecting ideas, and developing a storyboard to accomplishing business objectives, video production is complicated.

### **Design Captivating Characters or Visual Elements** **:**

 For many years, the customer journey has been heavily influenced by brand identification and brand trust. Finding a simple technique to easily convey your brand to a target demographic is the difficult part. Animated explainer videos excel in this situation. A useful tool for promoting goods, services, concepts, and companies is an animated explainer film. Explainer videos are an innovative marketing strategy that many forward-thinking companies actively include into their operations.

 There are several techniques to animate your films since there is no one approach that works perfectly. Be original and imaginative. You could be unsure about what style to utilize as a result. You should create many instances of the same character because of this. It aids in better appreciating the mood of the video. In this manner, you can choose which fashions suit your brand and the tone of the film the most!

### **Animate the Scenes Using Motion Graphics or Traditional Animation Techniques:**

 The second piece of advice is to make sure your animated film appears just as stunning without sound as it does with it. An animated figure often follows a script in an explainer film, utilizing objects and other visual elements to guide viewers through a process or explain a topic. When developing mascots for a family-oriented product offering, live-action videos may have a significant influence.

 The most enjoyable part is undoubtedly the illustrations! You get to choose and create your characters' environments. Users will be interested and more inclined to watch the video due to the animation. Because of this, it's preferable to employ titers in the film or make your animation seem catchy from the very beginning.

### **Incorporate Suitable Background Music and Sound Effects:**

 The audience won't be interested in the product if the voice-over isn't up to par. If they can't even hear what you have to say due to voice quality issues, how can they be interested? It's time to concentrate on the sound now. It is where you put together the narration, music, and sound effects to provide the audience the best experience possible.

 If you're just starting off, this step could seem a little intimidating. Consider employing a professional with built-in tools to achieve it effectively if you're searching for someone with expertise and experience using editing software. Furthermore, background music may provide pacing, intrigue, and a sense of setting to the film.

## **Part 3: Utilize Professional Video Editing Software for Post-Production**
