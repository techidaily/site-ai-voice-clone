6. **Legal and Ethical Boundaries:**  Upholding legal and ethical boundaries is important in all documents. If the video contains any medical records, it is essential to keep them confidential. In case of sensitive information, a translator must follow legal and ethical considerations.
7. **Requirements and Review:**  To achieve perfection, try finding a native translator for proofreading. The translator should follow any specific instructions provided by the client.

### 6\. Noise Recognition and Advancements

 The system should be able to detect background noises and adapt to different acoustics. It should detect and eliminate the background noises instead of transcribing them. In addition, it should keep upgrading to adapt to evolving language patterns.

### 7\. API Integration and Editing Options
