* **Step 1: Subscribe to VPN**

 Start by subscribing to a reputable VPN service. Look for providers that offer servers in the UK or Australia. These are the regions where many free World Cup streaming sites are available.

* **Step 2: Install VPN on a computer or smartphone**

 Download and install the VPN app on your computer or smartphone. Most VPN providers offer apps for various devices and operating systems, making installation a breeze.

* **Step 3: Connect to the Server in the UK/Australia**

 Launch the VPN app and log in with your credentials. Then, choose a server located in the UK or Australia from the server list. Connecting to a server in these regions will give you an IP address from that location. It allows you to bypass geo-restrictions.

* **Step 4: Go to BBC, ITV, or SBS, and start streaming**

 Once connected to the VPN server, open your web browser or streaming app. Visit the websites of BBC iPlayer, ITV, or SBS. You can now access free World Cup streaming content and enjoy watching matches live or on-demand.
