## Part 3: How To Choose The Best Tool To Translate SRT File

 Now, with all those options looking rather equally viable, how do you choose? Do you just pick one and go? Well, yes and no. If you just want to see how things work, any of those options is going to serve as a good measure. However, when you want to**translate SRT** subtitles online in a more professional way wherein your reputation and image are on the line, you want the best of the best. Here is how to choose just the right online subtitle translation tool for you.

#### 3.1: Ease of Use

 How easy is an online subtitle translation software to use? Most online SRT translation tools boast a simple, 3-step process. You will not find much variance here, because it is just a simple upload, translate, and download process.

#### 3.2: Editing Features

 Online SRT subtitles translator software may provide you with editing features. These editing features can be used to differentiate between products and are worth looking into. If one online editor does not have something that the other offers, clearly the other is your tool, other factors notwithstanding.

#### 3.3: Format Support

 Most software to**translate SRT online** support a number of subtitle formats. However, one or two might not support the format you want to use, so check the number of formats supported before using an online tool to translate SRT subtitles.

#### 3.4: Translation Accuracy

 When translating subtitles online, you want an online SRT translation tool with the highest possible accuracy to have a reasonable surety with respect to the quality of the translated subtitles. You do not want to appear immature and unprofessional due to poor quality of subtitles, do you?

#### 3.5: Data Privacy

 Now this one is KEY. No matter how good that online SRT translator AI tool is, you do not want to use it for your subtitles if that tool does not afford you a rock-solid data privacy. When you upload SRT to an online SRT translation software, what does that software do with your file afterwards? Does it store it forever? How is the communication between your device and their server happening? These are important questions that need clear answers for any user, but especially so when translating sensitive content or proprietary content.

### Tip 2\. Properly Plan Your Livestream

 It won’t be a good impression if you make mistakes in real-time interaction with viewers. Thus, make sure to prepare yourself before going to a live stream. To plan appropriately, collect the data and make an outline or presentation. You can livestream according to outlines and present your products.

### Tip 3\. Gain Expertise in TikTok Features

 Becoming a proficient user of TikTok features would be a plus for you. The first feature is its “Enhance” mode, which presents beauty filters to improve your appearance. The flip camera helps show something in front during live without moving the camera away. You can also share your live stream and filter your comments in real-time using TikTok.

### Tip 4\. Check TikTok Analytics

 Having a huge number of followers is not enough. You should also analyze when most of your audience stays active for a greater reach. For this, TikTok Analytics helps to supervise the viewers’ activities during specific intervals. Besides, you can also survey viewers to better understand which time is preferable for the maximum audience.

### Tip 5\. Promote Your Broadcast

 TikTok live selling improves when you engage with a broad audience. You can try multiple ways to promote your livestream and get more viewers. One way is to share your live stream link on other platforms or directly text the people. The second method is that you can create a promotional video of the scheduled live event. Viewers can watch your video as a trailer of the event to hype their interest.
