Users are not required to use reference speech if they plan to do one-shot voice cloning. Also, the requirement to manually enter statistics of duration is no longer essential. Only Linux users can install it with the correct TensorFlow and TensorFlow-addons versions.

### 7\. Voice-Synthesis (smoke-trees)

This approach creates a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. Then, it uses this audio for text-to-speech synthesis. SV2TTS excels with deep learning and uses a speaker encoder, synthesizer, and voice coder. It clones voices in real time with zero-shot learning. The repository identifies voices, and the synthesizer generates Mel-spectrograms from the text. Finally, the vocoder turns them into lifelike waveforms.

All you need to do is feed this repository your voice sample or custom voice, and it can synthesize a clone of it for you. You can also use a microphone to input your text commands through speech. There are also instructions given if you want to work with your own models on different datasets and language mediums.

### 8\. VoiceSmith (dunky11)

VoiceSmith is an easy-to-use repository requiring no coding experience. It fine-tunes a pipeline based on Delightful TTS and UnivNet for single or many speakers. Users can opt from a proprietary 5000 speaker dataset with automatic text normalization. Windows and Linux are supported, and an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is for faster training. Docker is essential for seamless operation for users exploring **real-time voice cloning online**.

* Install Requirements:

A RAM of less than 8GB may not work well with it, so it’s better to use at least 8GB RAM. To use this repository on Linux, you are advised to install Docker Engine. Users also get to play around with an emotional 60-speaker dataset-trained model.

### 9\. Voice Cloning App by BenAAndrew

This Python or Pytorch repository empowers users for effortless voice synthesis. You can enjoy automatic dataset creation, multi-language support, and easy remote training. It allows you to build datasets and proceed further by using a training model. The tool offers new datasets and lets you extend existing datasets for voice cloning. This simple approach elevates your experience of **real-time voice cloning on GitHub.**

In future improvements, this repository is expected to support AMD GPU for better performance. Also, it claims to improve its batch size estimation. You can run it on Windows 10 or Ubuntu 20.04 operating system with at least 5GB of required disk space.

### 10\. Unet-TTS

Unet-TTS excels in unseen speaker and style transfer for one-shot voice cloning. It works in seconds to produce target audio through voice synthesis without fine-tuning. There are various speaking styles embedded in a seamless way. Its algorithm works on a skip-connected structure to capture speaker and utterance features. Users can get precise inferences of complex voice characteristics and speaking styles.

However, it’s still a challenging task to perform out-of-domain transfer. According to the similarity evaluation, the new model excels in speaker embedding and style modeling. The new model can also discover utterance-level details from the reference audio.
