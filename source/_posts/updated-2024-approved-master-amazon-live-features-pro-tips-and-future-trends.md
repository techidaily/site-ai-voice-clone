## Best 10 Free Video Translators to Mitigate Translation Risks

 Translating videos using AI can be a valuable asset to a company. With so many**free video translators** on the market, there are many tools to choose from. However, these free tools can often cause many problems, drastically increasing the risk.

 So, what are these risks, and how do we mitigate these risks? Let’s find out.

## **Part 1.** Potential Risks and Fixes of Translating Videos

 Nowadays, companies are looking less and less to hire translators and leaning more towards AI. But it isn’t because of the fact that AI is more accurate. It’s because AI just takes a fraction of the time a real human has. So, what are the potential risks of translating videos? Let’s find out.

### 1\. Accuracy

 One of the biggest issues with using free video translators is theaccuracy . Video translation software uses machine translation and machine learning, which can sometimes produce unpredictable and inaccurate results. Moreover, misleading translations can mess up a translated video and can potentially cause problems in the long run. This can be especially problematic for videos that contain important information, such as news broadcasts or educational content.

 The fix for accuracy is to get it reviewed by a translator who can then finally confirm whether the translation was done perfectly or not. Or, you should use a tool that is known for its high accuracy, which we will discover in the next part.

### 2\. Cultural Sensitivity

 Videos often containcultural references and humor that may not translate well into other languages. If not handled carefully, video translation can result in offensive or insensitive content. For example, we might not fully understand slang or jokes in one culture. To fix this issue, you can either simplify a video so it is understandable by everyone or use human review to explain it perfectly.

### 3\. Technical Problems

 Most free tools have problems processing a video that is mildly complex to process. If your video contains complex audio or visual elements, you might not get the most out of translation, and the tool might not even work.

 Another problem is that if a video has too much background noise, then the translation tool might not even detect certain words or phrases. In other words, you should aim for a video that is high-quality and even do some pre-translation editing to make sure that the translator can do its job perfectly.
