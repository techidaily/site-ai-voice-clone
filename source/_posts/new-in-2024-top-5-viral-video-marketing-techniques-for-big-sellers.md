* **Multiple Languages and Accents:**  Virbo offers multiple languages and accents that various avatars can have. Hence, you can break the language barrier and create live streams in various languages to target the native people.

### 2\. Set your objectives for TikTok Live

 When it comes to going live on TikTok, you also need to set your objectives. TikTok Live Studio provides many features that you can leverage. Hence, by planning your actions, you can make the best out of going live on TikTok

 For example, before your stream starts, ask yourself, what are your objectives? Do you want more views, more people engaged, more conversations, monetization? Once you have the goal in mind, then you can leverage TikTok Live Studio and make the most return out of your effective live session.

### 3\. Promote your live beforehand

 Before you go live using TikTok Live Studio, you need to promote your life. It is important to build up anticipation before actually going live on the platform. Hence, when you announce that you are going live and also tease what is going to be in the video, you improve your chances of getting more viewers to join, especially if you have an audience already.

 One of the best ways to promote is simply to make an engaging TikTok that only teases the content of your upcoming live session, sparking the curiosity factor amongst the potential viewers.

### 4\. Timing matters the most

 The right time when you push out your content is what matters the most. The same is true with YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and most other platforms. With TikTok, you must understand where your audience is mostly active in

 How do you find that? Well, you need to understand your audience deeply and when they are mostly active. For example, your audience could be active on TikTok on a certain time and that’s where pushing your livestream will get the most results.

### 5\. Take care of technical aspects

 Most people ignore the technical aspects of TikTok livestream. This is especially true if you want to come in front of the camera for live streaming purposes. For example, you need to make sure that your lighting, sound, and connectivity are perfect so nothing hinders the experience of your audience.

 With TikTok Live Studio, you can handle the hardware, which devices you want to connect, and the overall quality of your live streams. So, when you address the technical aspects the right way, you increase your chances of engaging the audience.
