## Part 2\. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

 Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers. Colorful and catchy videos grab the attention of the viewers and encourage them to buy the product. The main problem can occur if your target audience cannot understand the language that you have used in videos.

 As we all know, English is one of the most spoken languages. But not everyone speaks or understands it. People can face various problems in understanding the language. That's why video translators play a crucial role in every person's life. If there is no video translator, the world will become dull. Let's discuss some challenges that can occur if video translators do not exist.

### 1.Communication Gap Formed

 If your viewers understand the Spanish language, but you are creating videos in other languages. It will create a communication barrier because your audience does not understand the language in the video. Language barriers can affect communication and lead to misunderstandings. Suppose you are posting video lectures on the website to offer courses. In this case, if you don't use a video language translator, it will misinterpret the viewers.

![Virbo allows export high-quality videos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/free-online-video-translator-4.jpg)

### 2\. Failed to Reach a Large Audience

1. **Free of copyright infringement**

 It's essential to use images that are free from any copyright restrictions or infringement. Only use anime character photos that you have the legal right to use, whether they are from your personal collection or obtained from royalty-free sources.

1. **Proper lighting and resolution**

 Images with proper lighting and high resolution are essential for achieving crisp and detailed animations. Avoid images that are overly dark, blurry, or pixelated, as they may result in less visually appealing animations.

1. **Facing forward with a clear and visible face**

 Select images where the anime character is facing forward and their face is clearly visible. This allows for precise facial animation, including lip-syncing and expression changes, which are key elements in creating realistic talking animations.
