## Live Commerce Next Chapter: Can AI Unlock Its True Potential?

 The world of e-commerce has gone through a tremendous transformation in the recent past, with terms like **live commerce** , live streaming, live shopping, and live chat becoming a norm. S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

With the integration of AI-powered capabilities, APIs can evolve from simple data processors to intelligent agents capable of understanding and adapting to user needs. These enhancements empower developers to create applications that offer users more personalized and engaging experiences.

One of the significant advantages of AI-powered APIs is the ability to add natural language interfaces, allowing users to interact with applications using spoken or written language. This shift towards more intuitive interactions eliminates the need for complex user interfaces, making applications more accessible and user-friendly for a broader audience.

Moreover, AI can provide predictive analytics, enabling APIs to forecast future trends and patterns based on historical data. This valuable feature equips businesses with data-driven insights, facilitating better decision-making and strategic planning.

The introduction of AI also leads to automation within APIs, streamlining various processes and reducing the manual effort required. This automation enhances efficiency, saving time and resources while ensuring consistent and reliable results.

Security is another crucial aspect that benefits from AI integration. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, AI-powered APIs can continuously monitor and detect potential threats, ensuring a proactive approach to cybersecurity. This advanced security layer protects sensitive data and mitigates risks, fostering trust between users and applications.

Furthermore, AI enhances APIs with contextual understanding, allowing them to analyze user interactions and preferences in real-time. Armed with this knowledge, APIs can deliver highly relevant and personalized recommendations, increasing user engagement and satisfaction.

In summary, AI-infused APIs open up a world of possibilities, bringing advanced capabilities such as personalization, automation, predictive analytics, natural language processing, and improved security. As technology advances, AI integration will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the future of application development, driving innovation, and delivering exceptional user experiences. challenges they may present.

## **Part 1\. What is AI API?**

AI API stands for "Artificial Intelligence Application Programming Interface." It is a set of predefined rules, protocols, and tools that allow developers to integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into their applications, websites, or software products without building AI algorithms from scratch. AI APIs provide access to various machine learning models and services, enabling developers to leverage AI technologies such as natural language processing, picture recognition, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text, language translation, and more.

APIs simplify the process of incorporating AI functionalities into applications, making it more accessible and efficient for developers to harness the power of AI without deep expertise in the field. Major tech companies and AI platforms offer AI APIs, allowing developers to tap into powerful AI services and integrate them seamlessly into their projects.
