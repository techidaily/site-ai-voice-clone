## Live Commerce Success Stories: Lessons Learned & Predictions for the Future

 The world of e-commerce has gone through a tremendous transformation in the recent past, with terms like **live commerce** , live streaming, live shopping, and live chat becoming a norm. S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

 The use of live commerce features has made significant impacts on business industries. From collaboration with influencers to engaging viewers in consultation, the following brands have transformed their engagement through live online shopping:

### 1\. Michael Kors: Fashionable Collaboration Boosts Engagement

**Lessons Drawn:** Collaborations with relatable influencers can drive significant engagement and sales. The live stream event also demonstrated the importance of interactive elements like styling tips and real-time Q&A in fostering connections and building trust with customers.

### 2\. Sephora: Beauty Unboxed with Community Building

**Lessons Drawn:** Brands can create a powerful formula for success by combining education, entertainment, and community building. Live streaming e commerce provides valuable product information and real-time interactions that can be used to foster loyalty while building lasting communities.

### 3\. Nike: Live Workouts Drive Brand Advocacy

![method and tips netflix subtitle translation](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/netflix-subtitle-translation-guide-13.jpg)

 Netflix, a renowned entertainment platform, offers a wide range of shows and movies to audiences worldwide. Subtitles play a crucial role in ensuring that viewers from different language backgrounds can enjoy the content. In this section, we will discuss various methods and techniques aimed at enhancing the quality of subtitle translation on Netflix.

### ●**Maintaining Context, Tone, and Style**

 Translating subtitles requires more than just converting words. Translators must grasp the content of each dialogue and scene to accurately convey the intended meaning. They consider factors like character emotions, background information, and narrative flow to ensure the translated subtitles resonate with viewers. Consistency in tone and style across subtitles maintains the immersive experience for the audience to ensure they remain engaged with the content.

### ●**Handling Cultural References and Idiomatic Expressions**

 Cultural references and idiomatic expressions are integral parts of language and storytelling. However, they can be challenging to translate accurately, especially when the cultural context differs between languages. Translators need to carefully adapt these elements to ensure they make sense to the target audience while staying true to the original intent of the content.

### ●**Adapting Linguistic Nuances**

 Languages have their own unique nuances and subtleness that may not have direct equivalents in other languages. Translators must navigate these differences skillfully to preserve the richness and depth of the original dialogue. This involves understanding linguistic nuances such as wordplay, sarcasm, metaphor, and finding appropriate equivalents in the target language.

### ●**Utilizing Translation Tools and Technology**

 Translation software and tools can significantly streamline the subtitle translation process, improving efficiency and consistency. However, these tools are not reliable and require human oversight. Translators leverage technology to enhance their workflow while also relying on their linguistic expertise and cultural awareness to produce high-quality translations.

### ●**Collaboration and Peer Review**

 Collaboration with fellow translators and subject matter experts is invaluable in ensuring the quality of consistency of subtitle translations. Peer review allows translators to receive constructive feedback, identify potential errors or inconsistencies, and refine their translations accordingly. This collaborative approach helps maintain the overall quality of subtitle translations and ensures that the final product meets the highest standards.

### ●**Cultural Sensitivity and Awareness**

 Cultural sensitivity is paramount in subtitle translation, as translations that disregard cultural norms or sensitivities can lead to misunderstandings or offense. Translators must conduct thorough research into the cultural context of the source material and seek feedback from native speakers to ensure that their translations are respectful, accurate, and culturally appropriate.

 By embracing these best practices, translators can effectively bridge linguistic and cultural barriers that will ensure Netflix subtitles resonate with diverse audiences worldwide.
