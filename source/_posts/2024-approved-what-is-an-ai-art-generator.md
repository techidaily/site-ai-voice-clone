## What Is an AI Art Generator?

## Part 1\. What is an AI art generator?

An AI art generator is a software or system that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to create or assist in creating art. It uses machine learning algorithms, and intense learning models, to analyze and understand various artistic styles, designs, and patterns. By training on large datasets of existing artwork, an AI art generator learns to generate new, original artwork that imitates or extends upon the available styles.

AI art generators can produce various art forms, including paintings, drawings, digital art, and multimedia installations. They can generate artwork from scratch or assist artists by providing suggestions, enhancing creative workflows, and exploring new possibilities. AI art generators can also be used as tools for artistic exploration, enabling artists to experiment with different styles, combinations, and variations.

The generated art results from a collaboration between the AI system and the artist or user. The AI provides suggestions and inspirations or even autonomously creates art pieces based on given parameters or prompts. The artist or user can refine, modify, or incorporate the generated artwork into their creative process.

AI art generators have sparked new debates and discussions around the definition of art, creativity, and the role of machines in artistic expression. They are a fascinating example of how artificial intelligence can be applied in artistic creation, pushing the boundaries of traditional artistic practices and opening up new avenues for creative exploration and innovation.

S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.
