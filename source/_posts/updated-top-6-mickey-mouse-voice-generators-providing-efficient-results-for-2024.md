Use Proper Grammar and Pronunciation

 While some apps can handle informal language, proper grammar and pronunciation generally lead to better results. This is especially true for complex sentences or technical terms.

Minimize Background Noise

Proofread the Translated Text

 Even the best apps can make mistakes. Take a moment to review the translated text and make sure it reflects what you intended to say.
