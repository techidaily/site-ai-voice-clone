## Part 1: What exactly is AI voice?

AI voice is an advanced application of AI language technology that utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to generate or manipulate human-like voices. Powered by machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks, AI voice systems excel in replicating and modifying agents with remarkable precision and an uncanny sense of naturalness.

The application of AI voice is extensive, and one of the latest applications is providing voiceover for AI-generated videos.
