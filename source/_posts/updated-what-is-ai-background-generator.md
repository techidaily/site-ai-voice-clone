## Conclusion

**Deepface Live** allows you to experiment with different faces when streaming live videos. You can present your videos as a celeb or even appear as if you are in a different location. While the**DeepFace Live application** can give you an incredible experience, you may have to deal with some ethical issues associated with Deepfake scandals. For this reason, we highly recommend using[Virbo Live](https://virbo.wondershare.com/virbo-live.html) as a safe alternative. It allows you to create AI-powered avatars that can seamlessly interact with your audience without negative repercussions.
