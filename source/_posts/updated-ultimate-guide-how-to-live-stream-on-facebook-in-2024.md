![china live shopping developing dynamics](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/china-live-shopping-industry-dynamics-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. The Basic Concept of Livestream Shopping: What It Is?

 Livestream shopping is a practice that involves product promotion through a live video. This innovative concept creates an engaging environment for shopping through live video entertainment. Unlike traditional e-commerce, livestream shopping encourages active audience participation. As a result, viewers can get real-time product demonstrations and responses from the hosts.

### 1\. Video Equipment

 You need a fine camera to ensure clear video for high-quality product display. Also, there should be a tripod stand to keep this camera stable and cover multiple angles. You may also use ring lights or LED panels, as good lighting is crucial for better visibility.

### 2\. Audio Equipment

 Make sure to use an external microphone, as a dedicated one ensures better audio quality. Also, a hands-free microphone makes operability easier for hosts moving around in the live stream.

### 3\. Live Streaming Setup

 You must have a computer to handle streaming software and many applications. Use any of the streaming software, but make sure to have a strong internet connection. You also need a platform that supports live-stream shopping, like Facebook or TikTok.

### History of China Livestream Shopping

The giant social platform “[Taobao](https://www.yololiv.com/blog/the-history-and-future-of-live-shopping/) " introduced the concept of live-streaming e-commerce. This trend came to the attention of millions of Chinese consumers. Also, it appeared to be a convenient way, as everyone got smartphones and payment cards for easy procession.

 Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic proved to favor this shopping trend. This was because the physical market was almost shut down completely. Thus, China's live shopping took growth progress to approximately $352 billion by 2021\. Yet, there reached a point when it slowed down and devalued. Here are some of the critical reasons for the brief downfall of livestream shopping in China:

1. **Saturated Market:** The market became overcrowded with the gradual increase in livestream shopping. The increased competition among hosts led to its saturation and the pause in its growth.
2. **Consumer Fatigue:** Continuous exposure to livestream shopping events made consumers less enthusiastic. Also, regular promotional messages and a lack of variety made them lose interest.
3. **Scandals:** Mismanagement of live stream events and fraudulent practices hurt audiences' trust. It made this shopping method less reliable and trustworthy in viewers' eyes.
4. **Decreasing Innovation:Live stream shopping in China** gained sudden popularity. Yet, it no longer remained unique when more competition entered the market. It led to a decline in the excitement and engagement of consumers.

### Rise of China Live Shopping With Advancement in Technology

 A Chinese tech giant “Tencent” adapted to the challenges of this shopping trend. They released an in-app shopping feature in the “[WeChat](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/china-tech-giant-tencent-launches-new-online-shopping-feature-in-wechat-app.html) ” messaging service.
