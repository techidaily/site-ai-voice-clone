* Step 3\. Generate Scripts for Your Livestreaming Session

 After picking the avatar and background, locate the text box on the left side of the window. Now, type in the preferred text or utilize AI-generated scripts. Conversely, you can also use the services of "Human Interaction," where you only have to add a microphone for live interaction in the “Microphone” section.
