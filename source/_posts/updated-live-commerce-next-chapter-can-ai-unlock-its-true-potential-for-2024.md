S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

It is a very advanced piece of software that can convert words into a voice-over that sounds realistic, doing away with the need for a human narrator.

 The narrator's voice generator can modify and control the voice qualities. Makers can change the artificial voice's pitch, speed, and tone to meet the demands of their production. The narrator's voice generator will probably play a crucial role for everyone involved in audio production.

## Part 1: Why do you need a narrator voice generator

The narrator's voice generator rapidly converts text into spoken words, saving the content makers a lot of time.

### **2\. Cost-Effectiveness**

 When compared to voice actors, using a narrator voice generator may significantly decrease costs. Professional voice actors deliver customized narration of the highest caliber, but their services can be expensive, especially for projects requiring a lot of audio. While a narrator voice generator automates the translating of text process into voiceover, it provides a more affordable alternative.

### **3\. Multilingual Support**

It ensures that your material maintains a high level of professionalism and improves the user experience overall.

## Part 2: 5 Consideration for choosing a narrator voice generator

 Your narrator's voice is essential for your audience to have an interesting and professional audio experience. We'll look into a few crucial considerations to keep in mind while choosing a**narrator voice generator** . The possibilities of using a narrator voice recorder are diverse, ranging from**storytelling voice generators** to**Google translate male voice generators** .

### **1\. Voice Quality and Naturalness**

 An engaging and professional audio experience depends on the voice quality and naturalness of the generated voice. To select the voice that perfectly meets the requirements of your project, look for a voice generator that provides a variety of voice choices. It should be clear, with natural pronunciation and the right pitch and tone. Your listeners will be more likely to stay interested in your videos, lectures, or audiobooks if you have a natural voice.

### **2\. Multilingual Support**

 If you are creating content in several languages or have an international audience, it's essential to pick a**narrator voice generator** with multilingual support. Check that the voice generator covers the languages you will be working with and that generated sounds seem natural in each language. A sense of reality is added to your project by keeping the availability of many accents within each language in mind.

### **3\. Pronunciation Accuracy**

 It's important to pronounce words correctly, especially when using technical or industry-specific terminology. Look for a voice generator that can pronounce words and phrases correctly and has an extensive pronunciation dictionary. Some voice generators also enable you to modify the pronunciation and allow you to adjust your generated sound according to your particular requirements.

### **4\. Intonation and Emphasis**

 Spoken language needs to use emphasis and intonation to express the emotions, meaning, and context of a statement. The rise and fall of the pitch during speech is intonation, and it is used to convey a variety of attitudes, feelings, and intentions. Both factors help the narrator's voice generator effectively deliver the information. The narrator's voice generator must be able to modify intonation and emphasis to provide natural speech.

### **5\. Commercial use**

 Voice generators are widely used by both people and businesses to generate sound files for many kinds of commercial uses, including marketing and advertising, e-learning, and training.
