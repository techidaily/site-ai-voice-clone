![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-1.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-1.jpg)

#### Step 2

 Once you are on the online demo page, you will see a list of characters on the left side of the page. These are the avatars that you can choose from to create your funny talking avatar. You can browse the characters by category, such as animals, celebrities, cartoons, etc. You can also search for a specific character by typing their name in the search box at the top of the list. For example, if you want to create a funny talking avatar of Donald Trump, you can type “Trump” in the search box and select his character from the list.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg)

#### Step 3

 After you select a character, you will see their image on the right side of the page. This is where you can customize their appearance and voice settings. Below the character image, you will see an “Edit” button that allows you to change their hair, eyes, mouth, clothes, accessories, and background. You can click on this button and use the sliders and buttons to adjust these features as you like. For example, if you want to make your character look more funny, you can change their hair color, eye shape, mouth expression, etc.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-3.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-3.jpg)

#### Step 4

 Next to the “Edit” button, you will see two drop-down menus that allow you to choose a language and a voice for your character. You can select from over 25 languages and 200 voices that**Oddcast Text to Speech** Tool supports. You can also listen to a sample of each voice by clicking on the speaker icon next to the menu.

You will also see your character’s expressions and movements change according to your text. For example, if your text contains some punctuation marks or emoticons, such as ! ? :) :( etc., your character will show some corresponding emotions and gestures on their face and body.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg)

#### Step 8

## Part 3\. Tips for Effective Translation - How To Translate Correctly With AI Tools

 AI tools are just as good as people using them. If you’re not vigilant and don’t review the output, chances are you will get inaccurate or bad translations. Below are our tips to effectively**translate YouTube video without cc** that can help you get the most out of any AI translation tool.

### 01 Understand the Context

 AI tools often lack a complete understanding of the context. Writing a sentence out of context can totally change the message being conveyed. Therefore, you understand the overall meaning before finalizing a translation draft.

### 02 Clear Up any Ambiguities

 Ambiguous phrases are words in a language that convey more than one meaning, which can lead to inaccurate translations. So, clear up any ambiguous terms or expressions. Selecting a particular meaning of a phrase for your translation requires a keen eye for detail.

### 03 Consider the Cultural Nuances

 Every two cultures are different. This is particularly true if the two are from vastly different geographical regions of the world. So, you have to take into account the cultural nuances of both languages to ensure the translation doesn’t convey unintended meaning.

### 04 Use Reputable & Accurate Tools

 Always use reputable names for your transactions. There’s a good reason why some tools are more popular than others. Take Wondershare Virbo as an example. Virbo provides accurate and better translations for YouTube Videos than most other tools in the market.

### 05 Don’t Be Afraid To Customize

 Sometimes, the translation doesn’t need to be accurate word for word. You can customize the translation to convey the message in a better way. Some AI tools allow customization. You can adjust settings or provide additional context to improve the accuracy of a translation.

### 06 Handle Idioms With Care

 AI tools don’t translate idiomatic expressions in a good way. They translate in a literal way, which destroys the entire message. So, you should be aware of idiomatic expressions and always ready to find their best equivalents in a target language.

### 07 Hire A Human Editor

 If possible, have a human editor take a look and review the translation. The human eye can catch certain nuances that AI might miss. With a human editor, you have the confidence that they will be updated about translations and how to improve the message being conveyed.
