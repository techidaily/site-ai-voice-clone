## How To Create Video From Text Easily [Step-by-Step]

 Artificial Intelligence or AI has revolutionized video creation, making it faster and easier for creators to produce a video within minutes. Through[algorithms and neural networks](https://www.datatobiz.com/blog/smart-video-generation-from-text/) , you can now**generate videos from text** .

 OpenAI's Sora, for example, has been a hot topic for its ability to create ultra-realistic videos from text. This technology has the potential to transform the way we approach content creation across numerous industries. Creators of all backgrounds and skill levels can create professional-looking content with minimal effort.

 If you are interested in this new technology, this article will provide you with insights and practical steps on**how to create videos from text** .

## Part 1\. How To Use OpenAI’s Sora Video Generator

 While Sora is the most advanced and leading video-to-text AI generator by far, it's currently only accessible to "red team" researchers and not available to the public. OpenAI has not yet specified a public release date for Sora, though it is likely to be sometime in 2024.

 Once it’s available to use for the public, you can use Sora on their[official website](https://openai.com/sora) . Follow these steps on**how to use OpenAI’s Sora video generator** :

* **Step 1:** Write the prompt

 You will need to start providing a detailed written prompt outlining the content you wish to see in your video. This prompt could include descriptions of scenes or any specific visual elements you envision.

* **Step 2:** Generate the AI video (max. 1 minute)

 After submitting your written prompt, Sora's AI model will analyze and interpret your text, generating a video that encapsulates the essence of your prompt. The resulting video will last no longer than one minute.

* **Step 3:** How to create longer videos

 For those who want to produce longer videos, you may need to add additional details or scenes and synchronize them with the desired frame count to create a cohesive narrative.

## Part 2\. Sora Alternative: How To Create Video From Text

 If you're seeking an alternative to Sora for**creating videos from text** , you can try using invideo.io. Invideo.io presents itself as an effective text-to-video generator tool designed to transform textual content effortlessly into video.

InVideo.io features:

* Accessibility through mobile apps for convenient video creation on the go

* **Step 2:** Input the text prompt.

 Once you are on the interface, you can input your prompt. Give clear and detailed instructions for optimal results, and click the "Generate a video" button to proceed.

 _A realistic video showcasing the evolution of urban landscapes from the 20th century to the present day, highlighting architectural styles, infrastructure advancements, and societal changes. Incorporate visuals of iconic buildings, city skylines, transportation systems, and cultural landmarks to illustrate the transformation over time._

## Part 3\. Tips for Writing Prompts To Generate Videos From Text

 The key to**creating AI videos from text** is a good prompt. Unlike text-to-image generators, creating video prompts needs greater detail and clarity. With a good prompt, you can effectively guide the AI model in understanding the desired visual elements, narrative structure, and emotional context of the video.

 Here, we list a few tips to create good prompts for generating videos from text:

1. **Provide context**

 When crafting your AI video prompt, include specific information such as desired style, target audience, intended platform for posting (e.g., YouTube), and preferred tone (e.g., casual or formal). You can also indicate if you want high-definition video, like 4K videos.

1. **Be clear and specific**

 Although providing details is important, avoid unnecessary things that could confuse AI text-to-video generators. Keep your prompt clear and focused to ensure the AI understands your instructions accurately.

1. **Use descriptive language**

 Given that the AI will transform your text into videos, use descriptive language to depict characters, settings, actions, and objects vividly. This will help the AI create a more accurate representation of your vision.

1. **Incorporate keywords**

 Some AI video prompt platforms may support the use of tags or keywords to help generate video according to our intent. Use these keywords to influence the AI's output effectively.

1. **Structure the prompt effectively**

 Organize your prompt in a logical manner to ensure clarity and coherence. Start with an introductory sentence that summarizes the main idea or theme of the video. Then, break down the key elements or scenes you want to include.

 Moreover, pay attention to scene transitions. In case you need multiple scenes, make sure they transition smoothly to maintain a coherent flow when**generating videos from text** .

## Part 4\. How To Convert Video to Text Easily with Video-to-Text Tool

 To elevate your video further, you can convert your video to text easily using[Wondershare Virbo’s Video Translator](https://virbo.wondershare.com/video-translation.html) tool, which functions as a reliable video-to-text generator.
