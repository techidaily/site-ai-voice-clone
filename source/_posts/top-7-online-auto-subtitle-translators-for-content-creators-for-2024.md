## Part 1: Criteria for Evaluating Suto Subtitle Translators

 Subtitles and translation go hand in hand. Below is our criteria for evaluating their quality. Consider these criteria to ensure that the subtitling tool aligns seamlessly with your content goals.

* **Accuracy for Specific Accents and Dialects:** First is the tool's precision in capturing specific accents and dialects. This factor becomes especially significant when tailoring content to a particular audience with distinct linguistic nuances. Different tools show varying levels of accuracy for diverse accents and dialects. So, always test the tool with a sample of your content to verify its suitability for your objectives.
* **Speed of a Subtitling Tool:** The speed of a subtitle translator is another pivotal factor influencing productivity, particularly for those handling substantial amounts of information. Speed of a tool depends on factors like content length, noise levels complexity, etc.
* **Integration with Other Platforms:** The seamless integration of an automatic subtitling tool with other platforms used in content creation and distribution is another critical consideration. For instance, if you rely on video editing software or hosting platforms, compatibility with the chosen automatic subtitle service can come in handy. Some services go beyond by enabling direct uploads to video hosting platforms, such as YouTube or Vimeo, with subtitles already incorporated.
* **Quality of Customer Support:** No matter how user-friendly a tool may be, the need for responsive and helpful customer support can arise at any moment. Therefore, you should prioritize services that offer various channels for customer support, including email, phone, or live chat. Assess the availability and responsiveness of customer support before making a decision.
* **Support for Multiple File Formats:** The compatibility of an automatic subtitling tool with various file formats is essential, depending on the systems and devices involved. Different platforms and software may necessitate subtitles in specific file formats. Therefore, you should confirm whether the chosen subtitle translator online tool supports the required file formats. This will ensure adaptability and versatility, preventing any potential challenges leading to a waste of time and effort.
* **Languages Supported for Translation:** Lastly, these online tools often differ in the extent of their language support, so you should review the languages supported for translation. Some tools offer comprehensive translation support for a wide array of languages, while others may have limitations.

## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)
