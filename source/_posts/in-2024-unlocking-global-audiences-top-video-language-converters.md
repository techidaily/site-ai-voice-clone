## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.

Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively.

Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

## Exploring AI Face Generators | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. Understanding AI Face Generators

AI face generators are at the forefront of cutting-edge technology, enabling the creation of remarkably authentic and diverse facial images through the ingenious application of deep learning techniques. At the heart of these generators lie concepts like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which synergize to produce digital faces indistinguishable from real individuals' photographs.  
Deep Learning Techniques At the core of AI face generators are GANs, a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence. GANs consist of two neural networks the generator and the discriminator. The generator crafts synthetic images while the discriminator assesses them for authenticity. Through a cyclic process of creation and evaluation, these networks continuously improve, resulting in ever-more convincing faces.  
Data Dynamics A diverse and comprehensive dataset of facial images serves as the training ground for AI face generators. This dataset encompasses faces of different ethnicities, ages, genders, and expressions, allowing the generator to grasp the subtleties contributing to an authentic appearance. Preprocessing techniques, like normalization and augmentation, refine the data, ensuring consistency and enhancing the generator's ability to create coherent faces.  
The Latent Space The concept of a "latent space" is pivotal to the functioning of AI face generators. A latent space represents a multi-dimensional area where vectors carry information that the generator transforms into facial features. By skillfully navigating this space, the generator can produce an array of facial characteristics, ranging from the eyes' shape to the lips' curl.

## Part 2\. Four Key Components of AI Face Generators

AI face generators are complex systems that harness deep learning capabilities to craft lifelike facial images. Understanding their key components is essential to appreciating how these systems create convincing synthetic faces.

### 1\. Generator Network

At the heart of an AI face generator is the generator network. This network learns to transform random noise or latent vectors into detailed and coherent facial images. The generator deciphers patterns in the latent space through layers of neural connections to generate different facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth. As the network refines its understanding through training, it becomes increasingly adept at producing realistic faces.

### 2\. Discriminator Network

The discriminator network acts as the critic in the AI face generator setup. It learns to distinguish between authentic images and those generated by the generator. This adversarial dynamic between the generator and discriminator drives the overall improvement of the generated images. The generator strives to create images that can "fool" the discriminator into classifying them as accurate while the discriminator hones its ability to tell the difference.

### 3\. Latent Space and Noise Vector

The latent space is a multidimensional mathematical space where the generator operates. It's a representation of all possible facial features that the generator can create. A noise vector, often random values, serves as the starting point in the latent space. As the generator refines these noise vectors through its network layers, they transform into intricate facial characteristics, creating diverse and unique faces.

### 4\. Loss Functions

Loss functions are crucial in training AI face generators, particularly in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generator's loss function encourages it to create images convincing to the discriminator. The discriminator's loss function aims to correctly classify authentic and generated images. The interplay between these loss functions compels both networks to improve iteratively, resulting in increasingly realistic facial photos.

### 5\. Training Data and Preprocessing

The quality of training data significantly impacts the AI face generator's output. Diverse and representative datasets containing images of various ages, ethnicities, and expressions contribute to more realistic results. Preprocessing techniques like normalization and augmentation ensure consistency and enhance the generator's capacity to generate coherent faces.

### 6\. Styling and Customization

Advanced AI face generators can incorporate styling and customization options. These allow users to influence specific attributes of the generated faces, such as hairstyle, facial hair, or accessories. This customization capability enhances the generator's versatility for various applications, from character design in gaming to creating unique avatars.

Understanding these key components provides insight into the inner workings of AI face generators. These systems leverage the interplay of networks, data, and mathematical spaces to achieve their remarkable ability to generate facial images that blur the line between natural and synthetic.
