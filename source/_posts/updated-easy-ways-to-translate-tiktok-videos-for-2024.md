## Part 2\. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

 Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers.

Thus, China's live shopping took growth progress to approximately $352 billion by 2021\. Yet, there reached a point when it slowed down and devalued. Here are some of the critical reasons for the brief downfall of livestream shopping in China:

1. **Saturated Market:** The market became overcrowded with the gradual increase in livestream shopping. The increased competition among hosts led to its saturation and the pause in its growth.
2. **Consumer Fatigue:** Continuous exposure to livestream shopping events made consumers less enthusiastic. Also, regular promotional messages and a lack of variety made them lose interest.
3. **Scandals:** Mismanagement of live stream events and fraudulent practices hurt audiences' trust. It made this shopping method less reliable and trustworthy in viewers' eyes.
4. **Decreasing Innovation:Live stream shopping in China** gained sudden popularity. Yet, it no longer remained unique when more competition entered the market. It led to a decline in the excitement and engagement of consumers.

### Rise of China Live Shopping With Advancement in Technology

 As we discussed the downfall of**live-streaming shopping in China** , there is another point to ponder. The lack of technology was the main factor for all those reasons for downfall. With the advancement of AI and virtual avatars, it has again taken the pace of growth. These new technological systems are offering more versatility and security in livestream shopping.

 According to[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1301256/china-number-of-live-commerce-users/) , there is a gradual increase in livestream shoppers in China. This increase can be seen in the comparison chart pasted below:

 A Chinese tech giant “Tencent” adapted to the challenges of this shopping trend. They released an in-app shopping feature in the “[WeChat](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/china-tech-giant-tencent-launches-new-online-shopping-feature-in-wechat-app.html) ” messaging service.
