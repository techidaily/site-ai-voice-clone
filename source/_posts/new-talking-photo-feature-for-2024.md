## Part 2\. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

 Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers. Colorful and catchy videos grab the attention of the viewers and encourage them to buy the product. The main problem can occur if your target audience cannot understand the language that you have used in videos.

 As we all know, English is one of the most spoken languages. But not everyone speaks or understands it. People can face various problems in understanding the language. That's why video translators play a crucial role in every person's life. If there is no video translator, the world will become dull.
