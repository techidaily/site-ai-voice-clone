Traditionally, outdated technology does not offer such technical tools to automatically rectify mistakes in media content.

Overdubbing is useful as it adds richness to the original recording and removes errors. You can transform your videos with the **Descript Overdub AI** feature. **Descript Overdub** uses AI voice cloning that replaces incorrect audio without re-recording it. That overdubbed audio can blend in with any audio conditions.

You'll get the same result whether you record with a different mic or at a different place. It can fix audio mistakes in seconds that otherwise would take hours of editing. This feature saves money and verifies ownership before creating your AI voice. Users can edit, record, collaborate, and publish their work all in one place.

* While you can find various templates within the Descript library, the options are not flexible. Users are unable to find different options to choose template themes.
