Let’s look at some of its shining points!

### 1\. Real-time voice modulator

 Voicemod allows you to process voices in real-time, making it the ideal software for streaming on Twitch or making fun calls on Zoom. The AI voice generator has been extensively trained by voices from professional actors to give you human-like narrations.

### 2\. Extensive variety of voice effects

 Voicemod comes with more than 100 voice effects, with this voice-changing software adding more voices with new updates. The massive library of voice effects and sound modification features means you’ll get unlimited experience with Voicemod. It’s one of the few programs that allows you to modify your voices with reverb, pitch, chorus, vocoder, and other customization features.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

 You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:

**Step 1.** Install Voicemod on your Windows 7/10/11 PC or Mac computer and run it.

**![install and run voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-1.jpg)**
