## What Is an AI Art Generator? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. What is an AI art generator?

An AI art generator is a software or system that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to create or assist in creating art. It uses machine learning algorithms, and intense learning models, to analyze and understand various artistic styles, designs, and patterns. By training on large datasets of existing artwork, an AI art generator learns to generate new, original artwork that imitates or extends upon the available styles.

AI art generators can produce various art forms, including paintings, drawings, digital art, and multimedia installations. They can generate artwork from scratch or assist artists by providing suggestions, enhancing creative workflows, and exploring new possibilities. AI art generators can also be used as tools for artistic exploration, enabling artists to experiment with different styles, combinations, and variations.

The generated art results from a collaboration between the AI system and the artist or user. The AI provides suggestions and inspirations or even autonomously creates art pieces based on given parameters or prompts. The artist or user can refine, modify, or incorporate the generated artwork into their creative process.

AI art generators have sparked new debates and discussions around the definition of art, creativity, and the role of machines in artistic expression.

## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)

## Live Shopping Success Secrets: Unveiling Strategies From Real Case Studies

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the**online live shopping** success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

 A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

 Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

 One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

 As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

## Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream

The shoppable livestream featured exclusive, event-based discount deals for the customers. During the livestream shopping experience, sales representatives from Samsung would demonstrate various products to hundreds of viewers. At the same time, customers would communicate with the host through a chatbot using their nicknames.

![samsung live shop](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-2.jpg)

**Achievement:** The Samsung livestream shopping created a personalized and bespoke shopping experience, replicating the benefits of in-person shopping. Product demonstrations by sales reps and exclusive deals captivated hundreds of viewers. In addition, the interactive chat that was fueled by personalized nicknames fostered an engaging and lovely atmosphere. This led to a significant boost in sales and customer satisfaction.

**Lessons drawn** : Livestream shopping combined with interactive features and exclusive deals unlocks a powerful sales channel. With personalized engagement, brands can gain from fostering real-time connections with viewers. It also allows them to create an engaging and informative experience while fostering compelling value propositions.

With this feature, sellers can handhold their customers throughout the entire shopping process.
