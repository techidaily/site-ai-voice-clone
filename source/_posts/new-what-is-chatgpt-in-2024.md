1. **Lack of Context:** ChatGPT doesn't have memory of past interactions in a conversation, leading to occasional context gaps.
2. **Generating Inaccuracies:** It can sometimes provide incorrect or nonsensical answers that sound plausible.
3. **Sensitive Content:** ChatGPT's responses might inadvertently contain biased or offensive content despite efforts to prevent it.

2. **Rasa:** A framework for building conversational AI, allowing customization of chatbots for specific needs.

 AI streamers are avatars that replicate human streamers, keeping your viewers engaged.
