Voice cloning is a procedure in which a program generates an identical voice of a real person through speech synthesis. This technology uses deep learning strategies and AI to replicate a human voice through audio recordings. To clone a voice, there are several **voice cloning apps** comprising distinctive properties.

The voice cloning software analyzes the speech patterns, pitch, tone, and other vocal properties of the targeted human. Voice cloning has various uses in businesses and media industries.

## Part 2: How a Voice Cloning Works to Clone a Voice Efficiently

Voice cloning technology uses a structured procedure to bring accurate results. The first step is to collect the data from the targeted audio recordings. The audio recordings include the speech of a particular person with different phrases and contexts. Afterward, the program extracts the distinctive features of the person’s voice. The features include voice tone, pitch, rhythm, intonation, and other properties.

After collecting the data, the AI technology creates a training dataset. This dataset includes the input text and audio recordings of the individual. Then AI technology learns to match the input text to audio recordings. Now, the program uses a neural network as a deep learning technique to clone a voice. This network helps the model train through the input text and given vocal properties of the person’s voice.

Once the model gets trained, it generates a cloned voice by managing its internal parameters. Afterward, final adjustments and refinements are made to bring you the perfect output in the form of audio samples.

**Step 3:** Customize your video

 After selecting the talking avatar, input text and choose a voiceover option from the available choices to generate the voiceover for your video. Adjust the accent, speed, pitch, and volume to your liking. You also have the option to include subtitles and background music.

 If you'd rather use your own voice, utilize the Wondershare Virbo mobile app and tap "record audio."

**Step 4:** Download the talking avatar

 Finally, after completing the editing process, export your talking avatar video by clicking on "Create Video." Allow a few minutes for the export process to finalize, and your talking avatar videos will then be available for download.

## Conclusion

**Photo talking online** refers to the innovative capability of generating animated videos featuring speaking avatars or characters based on static photos. This feature, often powered by artificial intelligence (AI), enables users to make their photos “talking” by animating the subject's mouth movements and syncing them with recorded or generated audio.

 One popular platform that offers photo talking online capabilities is Wondershare Virbo. Through its online interface or mobile app, users can upload a portrait photo or select from a variety of ultra-realistic AI avatars.
