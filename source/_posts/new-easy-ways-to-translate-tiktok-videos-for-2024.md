## Part 2\. Difficulties in Talking Photo Technology

![talking photo difficulties](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/02/how-to-make-a-picture-speak-03.jpg)

 Despite its potential,**making your photos talk** encounters numerous challenges that hinder its seamless integration and effectiveness. Here, we outline some difficulties you might encounter:

### ● **Unnatural Mouth Shape**

 Despite advancements in facial recognition and animation, creating natural-looking mouth movements in talking photos remains a significant challenge. The technology often struggles to accurately replicate the intricate movements and subtleties of human speech.

### ● **Unnatural AI Voice**

 Another obstacle lies in the synthesis of natural-sounding AI voices. While text-to-speech (TTS) technology has advanced significantly, AI-generated voices can still sound robotic or unnatural. They often lack the nuances and inflections of human speech. Crafting a voice that is clear and emotionally resonant poses a significant challenge, as it involves capturing human expression and intonation nuances.

### ● **Lack of Lip Non-Actuation in Multi-Person Conversation Photos**

 In multi-person conversation photos, accurately synchronizing lip movements poses a complex challenge. Coordinating lip movements and distinguishing speakers is challenging, especially in dynamic group settings with diverse expressions and speech patterns.

### ● **Technical Limitations**

 Real-time lip-syncing and audio processing require a lot of computer power. Handling large amounts of data while keeping quality needs efficient algorithms. Additionally, it's hard to balance performance and resources in talking photo technology.

### ● **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**

 Besides technical hurdles, ethical and privacy issues arise with talking photo technology. Manipulating visual and auditory content raises concerns about misinformation, privacy breaches, and potential misuse of digital media.

 Get your AI-powered avatar to speak in real time by connecting and speaking into the microphone. What you speak into the microphone is automatically replicated by the AI streamer during the event.

#### 7\. Interaction Through Text

 Trigger and get your AI streamer to speak based on your own written text. You only need to enter the text that you want and click Send. The AI streamer will then speech what you have typed.

#### 8\. Cloud-Based Operation

 Virbo Live offers you more freedom with the cloud-based operation. All the features are available online, and you do not have to struggle downloading any software. Operate directly from the cloud and freely manage your product.

## Conclusion

 TalkShopLive offers sellers and shoppers a unique experience to sell and buy products during live shows. The platform is specially designed to help in the distribution, collaboration, and sharing of a truly shoppable and social video experience.

 As a social-selling network, Talk Shop Live allows users to interact with each other and make informed purchase decisions. However, hiring a human streamer and preparing their content can be time-consuming and expensive. That’s why we recommend [Virbo Live](https://virbo.wondershare.com/virbo-live.html) as the future of live-stream shopping. Get access to AI-powered avatars that will keep your viewers engaged while boosting your revenue from live-stream events.
