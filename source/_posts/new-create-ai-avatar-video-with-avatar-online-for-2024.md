 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

<a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605" border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

![Set a timer to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-8.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Start the recording

 Then click “Start recording” to record the video with the timer on.

## Part 1: What Are Talking Stock Photos and What Can You Do With Them?

 Let’s answer the most pressing question on your mind first. What are talking photos? Talking photos, simply put, are photos brought to life with video and voice. No longer are your photos just images – they can now include voice along with motion. That is one of the several uses of generative artificial intelligence that’s taking the world by storm.

 What can talking photos be used for? Talking photos can be used for fun as well as for interactive education. Here are some uses of talking photos, in a gist:

* An interactive and more engaging learning experience for children.
* Convey emotions better.
* Send personalized messages with voice!
* Capture viewer attention right from the start.
* Create memories by adding voice to photos for a more vivid memory experience!
