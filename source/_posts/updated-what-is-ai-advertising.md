## Part 3\. Potential risks and challenges in AI advertising

#### 1.Privacy concerns

AI advertising relies on a large amount of user data for targeting and personalized recommendations, which can raise concerns about user privacy. Improper data handling and usage could lead to data breaches or misuse, resulting in privacy infringements.

#### 2.Bias and discrimination

AI algorithms used in advertising may be influenced by their own biases and prejudices. If algorithms are trained on biased or insufficiently diverse data, it could result in ads that target or exclude specific groups, leading to unfairness and discrimination.

The AI then processes this input and generates a corresponding headshot that matches the desired criteria.

These generators can be used for various purposes, including creating profile pictures, avatars, character images for games or storytelling, and even for artistic or creative projects. It's worth noting that while these generators can produce impressive results, they might sometimes unintentionally perpetuate certain biases present in the training data, which is an important consideration when using such tools.
