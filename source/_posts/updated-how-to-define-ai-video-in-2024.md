## How to Define AI Video?

## Part 1\. How to define AI video?

AI videos are videos that are created or enhanced using artificial intelligence technologies. These videos often involve machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to analyze, modify, or generate visual content. AI can automate tasks such as video editing, synthesis, object detection, motion tracking, etc. It can also enhance video quality, generate realistic visual effects, and even create synthetic videos. AI videos leverage the power of artificial intelligence to streamline video production processes, improve visual storytelling, and push the boundaries of creative expression in video content.

## Part 2\. What technologies are commonly used in AI videos?

In the definition above of AI videos, various use cases can be observed, which also require the following potential technological means:

### 1\. Computer vision

In videos, computer vision techniques can be used for object detection, tracking, and segmentation to identify and extract specific objects or regions.

### 2\. Image Synthesis

Image synthesis techniques leverage AI algorithms to generate realistic visual effects, allowing virtual objects or effects to integrate into videos and create imaginative scenes.

### 3\. Video super-resolution

AI video technology can use deep learning algorithms to upscale low-resolution video images, enhancing the clarity and details of the video.

### 4\. Video restoration

By employing AI algorithms, videos can be automatically restored by addressing issues such as noise, artifacts, and blurriness, restoring the quality and visual appeal of the video.

### 5\. Video editing and clipping

AI technology can automate video editing and clipping tasks, including scene recognition, shot transitions, and audio processing, improving the efficiency and quality of video production.

### 6\. Video generation

AI generative models can automatically create new video content, such as generating scenes based on textual descriptions or creating visual effects based on music, providing new possibilities for creativity.

### 7\. Face recognition and expression analysis

AI video technology can identify faces in videos and analyze facial expressions and emotions, enabling applications such as human-computer interaction, emotion analysis, and personalized recommendations.

These technologies enhance video production efficiency, elevate visual effects, and enable the creation of compelling and innovative AI video content.

### Google Translate

 Google Translate is a well-known tool for translating text from one language to another, such as**English to Tamil translation** . Here’s how you can use it for basic translation:

* **Step 1** : Visit the Google Translate website or open the Google Translate app. Select the input and output languages (e.g., English to Tamil).

![video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg)

* **Step 2** : Type or paste the text you want to translate into the provided box. Google Translate will instantly translate the text into Tamil.

 Remember that Google Translate may not always produce the most accurate translations. It’s especially evident for complex sentences or specialized terminology.

### YouTube Video Translation

 YouTube offers a built-in feature for translating video titles and descriptions. It can also generate subtitles in many languages, including languages from English to Tamil. Here’s how you can use it:

* **Step 1** : Upload your video to YouTube and navigate to the video’s editing page. Click the**Subtitles/CC** tab.
* **Step 2** : Select the language you want to translate your subtitles into (e.g., Tamil). YouTube will automatically generate machine-translated subtitles.
* **Step 3** : Review and edit the translated subtitles to ensure accuracy and coherence.

**YouTube’s video translation in Tamil** feature can be helpful at times. But, it may not capture the nuances or cultural context accurately. Manual editing is often required to refine the translations. This is important to ensure they align with the original video content.

![china live shopping developing dynamics](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/china-live-shopping-industry-dynamics-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. The Basic Concept of Livestream Shopping: What It Is?

 Livestream shopping is a practice that involves product promotion through a live video. This innovative concept creates an engaging environment for shopping through live video entertainment. Unlike traditional e-commerce, livestream shopping encourages active audience participation. As a result, viewers can get real-time product demonstrations and responses from the hosts.

 Now that you know the concept of**livestream shopping in China** , let's head to its requirements. You don't need any physical platform as it operates completely online. Navigate through this section to learn about the requirements for successful livestream shopping:

### 1\. Video Equipment

 You need a fine camera to ensure clear video for high-quality product display. Also, there should be a tripod stand to keep this camera stable and cover multiple angles. You may also use ring lights or LED panels, as good lighting is crucial for better visibility.

### 2\. Audio Equipment

 Make sure to use an external microphone, as a dedicated one ensures better audio quality. Also, a hands-free microphone makes operability easier for hosts moving around in the live stream.

### 3\. Live Streaming Setup

 You must have a computer to handle streaming software and many applications. Use any of the streaming software, but make sure to have a strong internet connection. You also need a platform that supports live-stream shopping, like Facebook or TikTok.

### History of China Livestream Shopping

 The start of promoting and selling products through live video occurred in China in 2016\. The giant social platform “[Taobao](https://www.yololiv.com/blog/the-history-and-future-of-live-shopping/) " introduced the concept of live-streaming e-commerce. This trend came to the attention of millions of Chinese consumers. Also, it appeared to be a convenient way, as everyone got smartphones and payment cards for easy procession.

 Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic proved to favor this shopping trend. This was because the physical market was almost shut down completely. Thus, China's live shopping took growth progress to approximately $352 billion by 2021\. Yet, there reached a point when it slowed down and devalued. Here are some of the critical reasons for the brief downfall of livestream shopping in China:

1. **Saturated Market:** The market became overcrowded with the gradual increase in livestream shopping. The increased competition among hosts led to its saturation and the pause in its growth.
2. **Consumer Fatigue:** Continuous exposure to livestream shopping events made consumers less enthusiastic. Also, regular promotional messages and a lack of variety made them lose interest.
3. **Scandals:** Mismanagement of live stream events and fraudulent practices hurt audiences' trust. It made this shopping method less reliable and trustworthy in viewers' eyes.
4. **Decreasing Innovation:Live stream shopping in China** gained sudden popularity. Yet, it no longer remained unique when more competition entered the market. It led to a decline in the excitement and engagement of consumers.

### Rise of China Live Shopping With Advancement in Technology

 A Chinese tech giant “Tencent” adapted to the challenges of this shopping trend. They released an in-app shopping feature in the “[WeChat](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/china-tech-giant-tencent-launches-new-online-shopping-feature-in-wechat-app.html) ” messaging service. It led to a gross profit of almost $14 billion in the overall valuation. Moreover, several tools are now working in favor of livestream shopping, increasing users' diversity. Provided are three essential types of tools serving in this industry:

#### 1\. Social Platforms

 Some trending social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok represent different marketing features. The audience is already there, so you just need to go live to catch their attention.

#### 2\. Production Tools

 These tools can improve your production experience, leading to better conversion rates. Some even let you stream across multiple platforms and get comments.

#### 3\. E-commerce Tools

 The focus of this type of tool, like Shopify, is on the buying and delivering process. They handle things like bundling, discounts, cart management, and more. Their assistive role in developing live shopping systems is evident across the market.
