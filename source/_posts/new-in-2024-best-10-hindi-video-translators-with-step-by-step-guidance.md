Step 3 Upload Your Video

 Once the Video Translator window pops up, click on "Upload the video" you want to work with. Virbo's free plan requires uploads to be 30s to 5min long in MP4 or MOV formats, and a file size of up to 200 MB. Select the original language and a target language that you want your new subtitles to be in.

 Click "Translate" to start the translation process. Virbo will detect the human spoken language in the video and generate the translated video subtitles.

Step 4 Export Video with Translated Subtitles

 Virbo will translate the video subtitles to the desired language within a few seconds. The process is automated and no manual tweaking is needed. Click on "Export" to generate the video with new subtitles.
