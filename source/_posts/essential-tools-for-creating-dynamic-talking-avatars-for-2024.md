 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)
