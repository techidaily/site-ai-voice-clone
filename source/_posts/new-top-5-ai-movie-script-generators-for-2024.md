## Part 2: Important Factors to Consider While Translating Videos

 In the vibrant landscape of digital content, the ability to transcend linguistic boundaries is a crucial aspect of reaching a diverse audience. When venturing into the realm of video translation, it's essential to consider various factors to ensure an accurate and meaningful representation of your content. Let's delve into the key considerations that can significantly impact the quality of your video translations.

### 1.Content Accuracy

 In the intricate dance of video translation, accuracy takes center stage. When selecting a video translation tool, it's imperative to prioritize those that not only promise but guarantee precise content translation. The soul of your message lies in its accuracy, and choosing a tool that preserves the essence and nuances of the original message establishes a deep and meaningful connection with your viewers through every frame of the translated content.

### 2.Language Support

 The beauty of global content creation lies in its linguistic diversity. Opt for a video translator that transcends language boundaries—a true polyglot. Choosing a tool with broad language support empowers you to cater to the diverse linguistic preferences of your audience, creating an inclusive and accessible viewing experience. Your selected tool should be a gateway to a world where language is not a barrier but a bridge.

### 3.Subtitle Customization

 Visual elements, especially subtitles, contribute significantly to the overall viewer experience. Seek a video translator that goes beyond the basics, offering options for customizing subtitles. The ability to adjust not only the appearance but also the timing of subtitles ensures that your translated content aligns seamlessly with the rhythm and tone of your original video. This customization transforms your subtitles from a mere translation tool to an integral part of your storytelling.

### 4.User-Friendly Interface

 In the fast-paced and dynamic landscape of content creation, efficiency is the key to success. Choose a video translation tool adorned with a user-friendly interface—a design that is intuitive and serves as a compass guiding both beginners and experienced users effortlessly through the translation process. A tool that feels familiar and accessible contributes not only to a smoother workflow but also to a more enjoyable and productive content creation experience.

To learn how other companies have created explainer films, we advise viewing some of the greatest ones currently available. These 10 explainer video examples are ones we recently came across and would want to share with you. Let's think about these wonderful videos and why we love them without further ado.

### 1. [Microsoft Office 365](https://youtu.be/RH26Ncrvwsw)

![best-explainer-video-examples-microsoft.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-microsoft.jpg)

 Although Microsoft does not need an introduction, its services or products do. The full functionality of Office 365 is described in this video. We are aware that the simplicity of this video animation is precisely what we like about it. The explainer film made by the Microsoft team is the ideal example of what one should include.

 With the help of amazing characters, this 30-second animation showcases Microsoft Whiteboard's advantages and shows how to use it. The reason In a Nutshell is at the top of our list of the best animated explainer films is because they consistently provide the most aesthetically attractive videos.

### 2. [Making Teamwork Click](https://youtu.be/l-7awVpecvU)

![best-explainer-video-examples-teamwork.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/best-explainer-video-examples-teamwork.jpg)

 You know why this is one of the finest explanation videos we've ever seen? the animated explainer backdrop. There is no question about the quality of the animation, but pay attention to how the music precisely reflects the development of the narrative and gives it a new depth without interfering with the narration.

 Each year, businesses produce tens of thousands of explainer films, some of which are excellent and some of which are among the greatest ever made. Making Teamwork Click is just one of them. The basic backdrop and figures used here wonderfully complement the animation, which keeps your focus on the app.

### 3.[Ahrefs](https://youtu.be/krzF3YhmSMw)

 Ahrefs is a collection of SEO tools. In terms of managing SEO, the video demonstrates how to utilize and benefit from the tool. An adorable and enjoyable animation goes horizontally to the right as the pieces in the Ahrefs explanation video leap up and down on the screen. Cool cinematography with a horizontal pan to the right, cute effects, and smooth transitions. There is creative typography on it.

 Ahrefs has effectively disproven the notion that a company's brand is too corporate for animated explainer films. This animated software demo film demonstrates that combining stylish transitions with educational material is a pretty smart concept. We believe that this video's straightforwardness makes the use of animation ideal for the message it is trying to express.
