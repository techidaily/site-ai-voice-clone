AI advertising relies on a large amount of user data for targeting and personalized recommendations, which can raise concerns about user privacy. Improper data handling and usage could lead to data breaches or misuse, resulting in privacy infringements.

#### 2.Bias and discrimination

AI algorithms used in advertising may be influenced by their own biases and prejudices. If algorithms are trained on biased or insufficiently diverse data, it could result in ads that target or exclude specific groups, leading to unfairness and discrimination.

A voice-changing app can help you sound like a robot, cartoon character, celebrity, monster, and more. Therefore, these programs can be handy in industries like video gaming, telecommunications, podcasting, and more.

 Sadly, finding the perfect tool could be challenging in a world filled with**AI voice changers** . But worry not because we have done some deep research to help you find the most advanced AI voice-changing apps to use. We will review these apps based on their key attributes and the ability to generate varying AI voices. Keep scrolling!

## **Part 1\. Why do you need AI voice changers?**

 First, let’s start by listing some reasons why you need an AI voice changer app. As mentioned, there are many reasons to use an AI-powered voice changer as this program can unlock endless possibilities.

Below are some of the uses:

* **Privacy and security:** Assume you’re a journalist who wants to record audio about important information, but you don’t want to disclose your subject’s voice. Or, you can be a video gamer looking for the perfect AI voice that matches your video game personality.
* **Entertainment and fun:** Are your friends often pranking you with videos and audio recordings? You can score one against them by recording a prank audio or video using an AI voice changer tool.
* **Content creator:** Are you a content creator on YouTube, TikTok, Reels, and other platforms? You can use AI voice to create high-quality content with fun and engaging narrations. AI voices can also help create top-quality podcasts.
* **Accessibility:** Not everyone is blessed with a celebrity voice. It’s even more challenging to create content for those with voice challenges. But with AI voice transformers, you can convert text to audio before adding your preferred voice effect.
