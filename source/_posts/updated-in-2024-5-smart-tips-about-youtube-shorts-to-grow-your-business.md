#### Step 6

 Below the sliders, you will see a box where you can type or paste your text that you want your character to say aloud. You can use up to 1000 characters per request for this box. You can also use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags to add some pauses, emphasis, or other effects to your speech. SSML is a standard way of controlling how text is spoken by a speech synthesizer. You can use SSML tags by enclosing them in angle brackets (< >). For example, if you want to add a pause of half a second between two words, you can use the tag <break time=“500ms”/> between them. If you want to add some emphasis on a word or phrase, you can use the tag <emphasis> around them.

 You can drag and drop a video on this window or just link your video the old-school way.

Step 3 \- Select your original (source) and translated languages

 Next, you have to select your languages. If you are translating from Hindi to English, select Hindi as the original language and English as the Translated language, as you can see in the screenshot below.

![step guidance - using virbo to translate hindi - step 3 & 4](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/kya-aap-video-call-kar-sakte-ho-in-english-translation-04.jpg)

Step 4 \- Translate your video

 Finally, hit the orange “Translate this video” button at the bottom. You can also select some other options like lip sync and subtitles (for direct download).

 That’s all you need to do. Leave the rest to Virbo. Virbo will take some time, depending on the length, to translate the entire video and present your translation.
