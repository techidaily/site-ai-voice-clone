## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)

## Part 2: Reliable Tips to Create the Most Engaging YouTube Shorts Videos

 Although the AI tools mentioned above can help you generate YouTube Shorts according to your need, they cannot entirely replace human creativity. Are you looking to improve the quality of your YouTube Shorts? Here are a few tips that may come in handy in making your videos more entertaining.

### 1\. Keep it Short

 Remember, these short videos on YouTube are called “YouTube Shorts” for a reason. It is important to keep your content minimal and to the point. Your key focus should be on content delivery and making your videos as concise as possible.

 Moreover, you should value your viewer’s time as well. Studies also suggest that the attention span of users is gradually decreasing. So it is a good practice to determine the length of the video beforehand.

### 2\. Customize Thumbnails

 Thumbnails play an important role in the engagement of your video. It is how viewers decide if they want to click on your video or not. It is advisable to create custom thumbnails for your YouTube Shorts. Design a thumbnail that complements your content. Incorporate catchy and attention-grabbing elements to increase views.

### 3\. Consistency is Key

 It is important to remain consistent across your Shorts videos. Maintaining a consistent style and tone is a key element. It helps build a recognizable brand identity. Making a regular posting schedule is also a key factor on the YouTube platform. Sticking to a routine is always helpful whether you choose to upload weekly, bi-weekly, or another interval.

### 4\. Dynamic and Appealing Aesthetics

 Focusing on the visuals of your Shorts can enhance viewer engagement and make your content stand out. Aesthetically pleasing visuals capture viewers' attention. Dynamic aesthetics maintain their interest throughout the video. Unique and engaging elements also make your videos more memorable.

### 5\. Optimize the Viewing Options

 If you wish to boost engagement on your YouTube Shorts, catering to your viewer’s varying needs is imperative. Keep in mind the platforms that users will be viewing the video on. Most users view Shorts on their mobile phones. Hence, ensure your videos are optimized for vertical viewing. It also helps to make them easily navigable on small screens.
