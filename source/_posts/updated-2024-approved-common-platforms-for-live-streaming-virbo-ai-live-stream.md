#### Alibaba International

###### Operational Steps

* **Prepare Equipment, Network, and Browser**
* **Install Virtual Sound Card**  
  * Due to audio restrictions on Alibaba International, a virtual sound card is required. If your computer's sound device has a "stereo mix," it can be used as an alternative. Check the path: My Computer - Properties - Sound - Sound Control Panel - Recording.
* **Set Up "Stereo Mix"**  
  * Skip this step if using a virtual sound card.  
  * Click My Computer - Properties - Sound - Sound Control Panel - Recording, activate stereo sound effects, and set it as default.  
  * Click Properties - Listen, select your speaker device, and click OK.  
  * Confirm the settings by playing a video on your computer. If both speakers and the microphone show sound detection, the setup is successful.
* **Download and Install OBS**  
  * As Alibaba International has restrictions on webcams, OBS is needed as a virtual camera (future Virbo Live product features will support this).  
  * After installation, go to Settings - Video and change the resolution to "1080x1920." Select the "+" sign - Window Capture, and add the window of the Live Explosion (Live Version).  
  * Crop the URL bar by holding Ctrl + left-click. Click "Start Virtual Camera."
* **Prepare Materials**

* **Start Live Streaming on Alibaba Seller's Live Companion**

 Pick trustworthy, best rap voice generators. After reading feedback from customers and listening to demos, select software that produces real-sounding vocal outputs. A rap generator investment will significantly raise the overall caliber of your music.

 Select a voice generator that supports several languages, if your project requires multiple languages. Whether it's an online tool or interacts with your current editing program, be sure the voice generator works properly with your desired software or platform.

### 2\. Refine delivery

 AI rappers can be of great help if you practice and perfect your delivery. Work on your delivery, flow, and timing to produce a nice mix with**AI rap voices** . You'll sound more skilled and professional in your recordings if you regularly practice.

 Practice the rap lyrics and repeat them over and over until they come naturally. To bring out wordplay and punchlines, try out various tones and inflections with the voice generator. If you want to give longer verses without being out of breath, practice your breathing skills.

### 3\. Balance Realism and Creativity

 Try to establish a balance between accurate vocal production and creative experimentation. While maintaining authenticity is necessary, don't be afraid to experiment with novel vocal effects or styles. Use**AI rap voice generators** to express your creativity and add unique touches to the voice.

 Listeners can identify with the ideas, feelings, and emotions that your music communicates. Every rap music has a purpose, whether it's about overcoming challenges in a person's life, addressing concerns in society, or both. Make sure that the main point you want to express doesn't get lost in the use of the voice generator.

### 5\. Avoid Overuse

 Although rap voice machines are helpful tools, you shouldn't utilize them in your music too frequently. Find a balance between synthetic vocals to preserve authenticity and avoid a synthetic or robotic tone. Accept AI's promise to be a catalyst for creation while maintaining your unique voice and craft for a remarkable musical experience.

### 6\. Stay Ethical

 When combining AI-generated rap into your creative compositions, always give the platform or model utilized the appropriate credit and gratitude. Ensure you adhere to copyright and intellectual property laws and use AI-generated material responsibly and ethically.
