Additionally, not every design will complement your brand and your available assets.

 So, let's go through the 8 finest explainer videos and when to employ explanation YouTube video before you start the creation.

## Part 1: What is an Explainer Video?

 Both start-ups and large enterprises employ corporate explainer videos. They are brief videos that highlight the characteristics and advantages of a service or how to utilize a product, and are often featured on website landing pages or in form of SaaS explainer videos. When thinking about making an explainer video for business, there are several of benefits to take into account. It provides your brand a fantastic chance to showcase its identity since it is enjoyable and imaginative.

![animated-explainer-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos.jpg)

 Product explainer videos are a clever and fashionable choice for engaging with clients since they are also inexpensive and simple to make. In fact, [explainer videos](https://topexplainers.com/how-effective-are-explainer-videos-statistics-and-how-to-step-by-step/)  have been so successful in converting viewers that some businesses have reported conversion rates as high as 81%. There are several options when deciding which kind of video is appropriate for you. Here are some of the most well-liked and sensible choices.

## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)

Although these videos may just employ one font or a variety, the words nonetheless have a significant effect.

This may be reproduced using a 2D or 3D animated environment thanks to contemporary technologies.

## What Is an AI Script Generator? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## **Part 1\. What is an AI script generator?**

An **AI script generator** is a tool or system that uses artificial intelligence techniques, such as natural language processing and machine learning, to generate scripts or text content. It can be used in various domains, including movies, television shows, video games, chatbots, virtual assistants, and more.

AI script generators analyze large amounts of existing script data to learn patterns, language structures, and dialogue styles. They can then generate new scripts based on this learned knowledge. The generated scripts may include dialogue, scene descriptions, character actions, and other elements typically found in scripts.

These tools can be helpful for writers, content creators, and developers who need to generate scripts quickly or seek inspiration for their creative projects. However, it's important to note that while AI script generators can provide valuable suggestions and assistance, they may not replace the creative input and human touch required for crafting high-quality scripts. Human oversight and editing are usually necessary to refine and tailor the generated content to specific needs and artistic visions.

## **Part 2\. How can an AI script generator revolutionize your work?**

An AI script generator can be a valuable tool in several ways to help with your work:

#### **1\. Idea generation**

If you're experiencing writer's block or struggling to come up with ideas, an AI script generator can provide fresh concepts, dialogue prompts, or scene suggestions to spark your creativity. It can offer new perspectives and help you explore different directions for your script.

#### **2\. Efficiency and productivity**

AI script generators can save time by automating the initial drafting process. They can quickly generate dialogue, scene descriptions, or even entire scripts based on your input or parameters. This can be especially useful when working on projects with tight deadlines or when you need to generate multiple script iterations.

#### **3\. Collaboration and feedback**

AI script generators can facilitate collaboration by providing a starting point for discussions and feedback. You can share the generated scripts with your team or colleagues, enabling them to provide input, make revisions, or further develop ideas. It can serve as a collaborative tool to streamline the scriptwriting process.

#### **4\. Inspiration and experimentation**

AI script generators can offer unique and unexpected ideas you may not have considered otherwise. They can introduce unconventional plot twists, character interactions, or narrative arcs, encouraging you to explore new creative possibilities and push the boundaries of your work.

#### **5\. Learning and improvement**

By using an AI script generator, you can gain insights into writing techniques, storytelling structures, and dialogue patterns. Studying the generated scripts can help you identify strengths and weaknesses in your writing style, providing opportunities for growth and improvement as a writer.

However, it's important to remember that an AI script generator should be seen as a tool to assist and enhance your work rather than replace human creativity and expertise. Reviewing, editing, and refining the generated content to align it with your artistic vision and ensure its quality is crucial.
