## Part 1: Must-Know Secrets to YouTube Live

### 2\. Discuss hot topics your audience wants to talk about

![Hot Topic](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-3.jpg)

 If you are a new creator who is looking to make his mark as a successful streamer, then you should capitalize on what already seems to be working. Most creators make this fatal mistake when they try to invent something new, earlier in their streaming career.

 However, you need to have a loyal audience in order to do so. People use YouTube to get information or some sort of entertainment. Whether you are a new creator or someone who already has a set audience, your main focus should be to discuss hot topics or play trending games to get views faster and efficiently.

 To make it easier for you, let’s say that a new game rolls out. By discussing the game or playing the game on live stream, you are going to attract the right audience according to your YouTube channel and gain followers instead of being clueless.

### 3\. Ranking live videos

![Ranking Live Videos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-4.jpg)

 Yes! It is possible to rank videos on the go as you go live. By doing YouTube research, you can leverage different keywords and rank for them as you go online. Most people make evergreen videos and put pre-recorded ones but compared to them, the live world is still small.

 That is exactly your ticket to success. First, you need to understand the problems that your audience has. How can you solve them? What concerns do they have on a particular topic? Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.

 It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.

### 4\. Building a community

![Building a community](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-5.jpg)

 With other tips on the list, you must be vary of how important your audience is especially when it comes to YouTube Live. The third secret and one of the most important**YouTube streaming guidelines** is building a community.

 As you build your live community, you will have audience retention, meaning more people will come to you whenever you go live. You need to understand your audience deeply, what time you get the most viewers, and what interests your audience.

 Once you do that, you also need to talk to them as they come live. Build deep connections with your viewers and you will see a huge increase in your subscribers and overall viewer count.

### 5\. Promote your broadcast

![Promote your broadcast](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-6.jpg)

 We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.

 First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.

 But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.

### 6\. Collaboration

![Collaboration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-7.jpg)

 Once you grow a little bit, you can collaborate with other streamers to join two audiences together. If you look closely, we have multiple streamers connecting with each other and having fun together. For example, Fouseytube sometimes connects with Sneako and both of them then go to N3on to make the biggest live stream in the history of social media.

 When you collaborate with someone and entertain the audience in a way that they want to be, You need to not only build a community of people but also collaborate with other streamers which will open new aspects of your streaming journey.

## Part 2: Common Problems & Solutions of YouTube Live

 YouTube Live can have a plethora of problems like engagement issues, user-interaction issues, stream not starting, and some other technical issues. However, most of these problems have solutions which we are going to cover in this part.

 But if you want a complete AI Live Streamer guide, then you should check out[Virbo Live Stream User Guide](https://virbo.wondershare.com/guide-live.html) as it moves you through every step and provides a complete guideline of steps to follow to have the perfect stream up and running.

### 1\. Stream not starting

![Stream not starting](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-8.jpg)

 One of the most common problems with YouTube Live is streams not starting. Imagine you have an audience of people waiting but the stream just does not start. It can be unresponsive, which is a common issue with YouTube Live.

 Here’s what you can do to fix the issue. Firstly, you need to verify your account and wait for 24 hours for this issue to be fixed. It is because new channels need this type of verification to allow you to start streaming.

 However, if that still doesn’t fix the issue, you should try restarting your streaming service and computer. After a good reset, you can start streaming again and it should get you up and running.

### 2\. Poor video and audio quality

![Poor video and audio quality](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-9.jpg)

 We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

 Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

### 3\. Laggy stream

![Laggy stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-10.jpg)

 Similar to poor video and audio, a laggy stream can occur due to a bad internet connection. Most streamers have a plethora of applications opened in the background that all take some level of internet.

 Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.

### 4\. Lack of interaction on stream

![Lack of interaction on stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-11.jpg)

 A lot of people suffer from a lack of interaction even if they have slowly started to build a respectable viewer count. So, what should you do in that situation? Actively engage with viewers by responding to comments, asking questions, and running polls/contests.

 Encourage viewers to interact with each other. Invite guests or co-hosts to add diverse perspectives. You should always be trying something new that would excite the viewers into taking part.

## Conclusion

 YouTube Live is one of the best ways for creators to grow their brands. Whether it is using AI avatars with Virbo or doing real streams, we have discussed some of the[best ways](https://virbo.wondershare.com/virbo-live.html) you can grow your YouTube Live.

Use Proper Grammar and Pronunciation

 While some apps can handle informal language, proper grammar and pronunciation generally lead to better results. This is especially true for complex sentences or technical terms.

## Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the**online live shopping** success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

 A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

 Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

 One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

 As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:
