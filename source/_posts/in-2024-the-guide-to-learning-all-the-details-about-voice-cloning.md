## Part 4\. Troubleshooting Issues When Converting Video Voice to Text

 Creating clear and accurate transcripts is essential for professional settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls that can impact transcription quality:

Issue 1: Background Noise

**Solution:** Noisy recordings can cause problems with transcription accuracy. Luckily, many video editing programs have noise-reduction features. Running your audio through one of these before conversion can make a big difference.

Issue 2: Accents or Dialects

**Solution:** Most speech recognition software is good these days, but accents and dialects can still trip them up. Check your software’s settings for options to adjust the recognition model. Some programs even let you upload a sample of the speaker’s voice to improve accuracy.

Issue 3: Punctuation Errors

**Solution:** Some software offers built-in punctuation correction you can use. If unavailable, find a separate grammar tool after conversion. Always proofread the transcript yourself for any missing punctuation.

Issue 4: Overlapping Voices of Speakers

**Solution:** If the video has multiple speakers, try software that can differentiate voices. This includes interviews and panel discussions. You can always transcribe each speaker’s section if that's not an option. Then, add timestamps to identify speaker changes in the transcript.

![online meeting concept](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/convert-video-voice-to-text-17.jpg)

Issue 5: Inconsistent Transcription Format

**Solution:** Most video-to-text software allows you to format after the converter generates the transcript. You can adjust fonts, add paragraph breaks, and even format speaker identification within the program. Also, you can always export the transcript to a word processor for in-depth formatting.

##### Step 2 Choose AI Streamers and Background

 Add a virtual streamer of choice to your live stream room from the virtual host library.**Virbo Live** provides a wide range of AI avatars and backgrounds to suit your needs. You can also customize the avatar and background the way you like, and add stickers to enhance your viewers' experience.

##### Step 3 Enter Text or Voice

 With the avatar set, you need to upload your audio or enter a script with all the necessary details. Virbo Live allows you to automate this step with the AI smart scriptwriter and AI translator. Simply enter basic details about your product, and the Smart AI Scriptwriter will generate a fully detailed script for the avatar. Be sure to specify the language that you want to use and the desired tone for a more accurate script.

##### Step 4 Start Live Streaming

 After choosing your AI Avatar and generating or adding a script, click "Start Live Streaming". This allows you to AI stream your Avatar through OBS software, and allow the Avatar to interact with your audience on platforms like Facebook Live and YouTube.

## Conclusion

**Deepface Live** allows you to experiment with different faces when streaming live videos. You can present your videos as a celeb or even appear as if you are in a different location. While the**DeepFace Live application** can give you an incredible experience, you may have to deal with some ethical issues associated with Deepfake scandals. For this reason, we highly recommend using[Virbo Live](https://virbo.wondershare.com/virbo-live.html) as a safe alternative. It allows you to create AI-powered avatars that can seamlessly interact with your audience without negative repercussions.
