One of the prominent applications of artificial intelligence is in the field of AI voice cloning. It eliminates bad-quality audio in a snap and replaces it with natural-sounding AI voices. Where production houses used to pay millions to voice actors, they can now use voice clones. This article will discuss the rise of voice cloning, its applications, and a relevant tool.

## Part 1: A Basic Definition of AI Voice Cloning

**AI voice cloning** refers to the techniques that enable users to generate deepfake voices from a sample. If you provide a sample that fulfills data requirements, AI will generate a voice you can customize. At the core, vast training datasets make the backbone of these tools. This data enables AI to analyze samples, recognize frequencies, and generate an exact AI voice.

For the perfect voice cloning, neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) collaborate. They ensure the level of similarity and focus on elements like tone, emotion, and accents.

The next step involves the integration of Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology in these **AI voice cloning-free** tools. This means you can clone the voice of Taylor Swift and use TTS technology to make it say whatever you want.
