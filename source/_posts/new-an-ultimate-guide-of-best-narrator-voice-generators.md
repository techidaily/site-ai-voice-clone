 Do you want people around the world to watch your videos on Twitter? What about those who might want to watch but don't speak your language? Without video translation, you're missing out on reaching many potential viewers.****Translating Twitter videos** lets you connect with audiences from different cultures and languages.

 Translated videos also lead to better engagement. Viewers are more likely to watch accurately translated videos on Twitter. If your video has a bad translation, you could lose viewers. Translations help more people to understand your content. That way, they will have a chance to share your video. This leads to higher engagement with viewers worldwide.

 If you have videos that need translating, we're here to help and guide you through the process.

![translate-twitter-video-1.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-1.jpg)

## **Part 1\. Why Translate Twitter Video?**

 Twitter has a vast user base worldwide. It offers an unparalleled opportunity to connect with diverse audiences. But the language barrier often stands as a significant obstacle.****Translating Twitter videos** addresses this challenge head-on. By offering many benefits beyond mere language comprehension.

Here's some benefit of translating video:

* **Accessibility to diverse audiences**

 When you translate videos on Twitter, you're breaking down language barriers. So everyone, no matter their language, can understand your content. This means more people connect with you, opening to diverse communities worldwide.

* **Increased reach and engagement**

 Translating videos helps you reach more people on Twitter. If your content speaks different languages, more viewers can engage with it. Making your message go further and have more impact.

* **Building a more inclusive online community**

 By translating your videos, you're making Twitter a more welcoming place for everyone. Regardless of their language. This builds a stronger community where diverse voices are valued and heard.

## **Part 2\. Are There Built-in Translation Features on Twitter for Video?**

 Twitter has limited features in terms of translation. Currently, Twitter only allows the translation of text within tweets. There are no built-in features for translating video content directly on the platform. But, you can enable closed captions to aid in understanding video content.

Here are the steps to turn on closed captions videos on Twitter:

* **Step 1.** Open the Twitter app or website and find the video tweet that you want to watch with closed captions. This tweet could be in your timeline or a user's profile.
* **Step 2.** Tap the video's thumbnail to play the video.
* **Step 3.** Tap on the three dots at the top right of the screen to bring up the video player controls.

![Twitter’s video playback](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-2.jpeg)

* **Step 4.** Look for the closed captions (CC) icon on the video player controls. It usually appears as a small icon with the letters "Captions" or "CC" inside a rectangle. Tap on this icon to turn on closed captions.

![Turn on Captions](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-3.jpeg)

* **Step 5.** Once closed captions are enabled, watch the video as usual. You should see text at the bottom of the screen that provides a written transcription of the audio content.

 However, closed captions on Twitter are not perfect. Not every video on Twitter shows this feature. That's why this feature is not a popular option for many users.

## **Part 3\. How to Translate Twitter Video With Twitter Translator Bots**

 Users must use external tools such as bot accounts and AI video translators to translate videos on Twitter. These tools can help translate video content on Twitter. Making it more accessible to diverse audiences. While****Twitter video translation** features are limited, alternative methods can overcome these language barriers.

Using bot accounts on Twitter to translate videos involves a few steps:

* **Step 1.** Find a Translation Bot Account

 Look for bot accounts on Twitter specifically designed for translation purposes. Some of them are @TranslateMom, @Translatevidapp, and @vidtranslator. These accounts are programmed to translate video to text-based content automatically.

* **Step 2.** Follow the Bot Account

 Once you've found a suitable translation bot account, they usually require you to follow them to receive the translations.

* **Step 3.** Tag the Bot Account

 When you find a video tweet you want to translate, reply to that tweet and tag the translation bot account. You can mention the bot account's username and request a translation.

* **Step 4.** Wait for Translation

 The translation bot account will automatically respond to your tweet with the translated text. Depending on the bot's processing time and availability, this may take a few moments.

* **Step 5.** Review the Translations

 Once you receive the translation, review it to ensure accuracy and readability. Remember that automated translations may not always be perfect. So, use your judgment to assess the quality of the translation.

## Free MSNBC Live: Online Stream for the Latest Shows for All Devices

 MSNBC is amongst the top cable news networks especially on Facebook, edging even Fox News and CNN. It contains some of the hottest shows that are loved by most Americans. MSNBC delivers news, articles, videos, and TV shows for all devices and across all audiences.

 But being a paid service, it chases away a lot of the users. So, if you want to watch the MSNBC live stream free, we have got the perfect list of websites that will allow you to watch your favorite shows without spending credits or money.

## **Part 1:** Best 5 Free MSNBC Live Streaming Sites

### 1\. LiveNewsChat

 One aspect of LiveNewsChat that we did not like is that it has a lot of annoying pop-up ads. But the quality pays for the hindered user experience which makes LiveNewsChat one of the best platforms for**MSNBC live streaming free online.**

[Live HD TV](https://www.livehdtv.net/msnbc-news/) is amongst the nicest-looking websites on the list. However, it doesn’t just look nice but has a utility that would boost your user experience to the fullest. Aside from MSNBC, there are a plethora of other channels as well like CBC, ABC, CBS, and other news channels.

 What’s unique about Live HD TV is that it provides you with multiple servers for MSNBC, which means that you can switch the servers if one of the links is not working. The platform also displays ads minimally, with the player box not showing ads, which basically means that ads are nowhere to be found on this platform. So, if you want to**watch MSNBC live,** then there is no better choice than a platform like Live HD TV.

[STREAMFARE](https://streamfare.com/msnbc) takes things to the next level by providing the simplest experience you can demand. As soon as you enter the website, you are greeted with a video player that would instantly play the live MSNBC show.

 But what’s more interesting is that the video player and the servers that are used in this platform also allow you to have complete control over your video quality. Sure, you are not getting the 4K quality here but you can still control it up to 720p.

 There are advanced options too that are related to ad control, latency, and more. So, if you are ever having a problem on the platform, you can manually fix it. All in all, STREAMFARE is one of the best**MSNBC live streams free online** that you can experience and have fun watching.

### 4\. LiveNewsMag

![LiveNewsMag](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-4.jpg)

[LiveNewsMag](https://www.livenewsmag.com/msnbc-news-live-stream/) has one of the prettiest website designs and it allows you to watch MSNBC Live for free. However, there’s a catch. You will need to experience ads since the website won’t even work even if you have an ad blocker installed and activated.

 However, you can join LiveNewsPro which will disable ads for your particular account on the platform. LiveNewsMag provides one of the fastest loading times and although you will be greeted with ads from time to time, you are still getting live news on MSNBC right in the LiveNewsMag platform.

### 5\. FreeInterTV

![FreeInterTV](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-5.jpg)

[FreeInterTV](http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2565) is an all-in-one package that also displays MSNBC news online. It is a great platform and a free alternative to the original website. However, the magic of this platform is that it provides you with most TV channels from all across the world.

 The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

 Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.

#### Features

| **Aspects**         | Performance                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Ads**             | Ad free                          |
| **Loading Speed**   | Excellent loading speed          |
| **Quality**         | Up to 720p (HD) but usually 480p |
| **User Experience** | Confusing design                 |
