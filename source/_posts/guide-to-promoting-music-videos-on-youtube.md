## Live Commerce Next Chapter: Can AI Unlock Its True Potential?

 The world of e-commerce has gone through a tremendous transformation in the recent past, with terms like **live commerce** , live streaming, live shopping, and live chat becoming a norm. S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

 The use of live commerce features has made significant impacts on business industries. From collaboration with influencers to engaging viewers in consultation, the following brands have transformed their engagement through live online shopping:

**Lessons Drawn:** Brands can create a powerful formula for success by combining education, entertainment, and community building. Live streaming e commerce provides valuable product information and real-time interactions that can be used to foster loyalty while building lasting communities.

### 3\. Nike: Live Workouts Drive Brand Advocacy

These tools often integrate machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to perform tasks such as video editing, scene recognition, automated video generation, voiceover synthesis, and more.

With AI video makers, users can create professional-looking videos more efficiently and with less manual effort. These tools can analyze raw video footage, apply filters, add visual effects, generate subtitles, and even suggest relevant music or soundtracks based on the video's content. Some AI video makers can also create videos from scratch using provided assets, such as images and text, transforming them into dynamic and engaging visual presentations.

The use of AI in video creation has significantly simplified the process and made it accessible to individuals and businesses without specialized video editing skills. As AI technology advances, AI video makers will likely become even more sophisticated, allowing for more creative and innovative video productions.

## Part 2\. Any differences between an AI video maker and a generator?

Yes, there is a difference between an AI video maker and an AI video generator, although they are related concepts.

### 1\. AI Video Maker

## What Is an AI Artist?

## **Part 1\. What is an AI artist?**

AI artist refers to an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to create art autonomously or assist human artists in their creative process. AI artists use machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to analyze and understand patterns in existing artworks and generate new art based on that knowledge.

Some AI artists can create paintings, drawings, or digital art, while others can generate music, poetry, or video content. They work by learning from a vast dataset of existing artworks or creative content and then producing original pieces that mimic the style, themes, or elements present in those examples.

AI artists are not meant to replace human creativity but rather to augment it and inspire new ideas. They can be valuable tools for artists to experiment with different styles, generate concepts, or overcome creative blocks. AI art is continually evolving, and the creations of AI artists often spark discussions about the intersection of technology and creativity in the art world.

## **Part 2\. Guidelines for responsible use of AI artists**

When utilizing AI artists, it is essential to consider the following factors:

#### 1\. Data and Copyright

Ensure that the AI artist's training data and the generated content do not violate copyright or intellectual property rights. Make sure to use properly licensed datasets and obtain permission when using copyrighted materials as inputs.

#### 2\. Bias and Fairness

AI artists learn from existing data, and if the data contains biases, it may reflect in the generated content. Be cautious of any biases present in the training data and take steps to mitigate or address them to ensure fairness and inclusivity in the generated art.

#### 3\. Creative Input

While AI artists can be helpful tools, it's essential to maintain the artist's creative input and not rely solely on AI-generated content. AI should be seen as a collaborator or a source of inspiration rather than a substitute for human creativity.

#### 4\. Experimentation and Exploration

Use AI artists to explore new artistic styles, techniques, and ideas. Embrace the experimental nature of AI-generated art and push the boundaries of creativity with technology.

#### 5\. Ethical Use

Be mindful of the content generated by AI artists and ensure that it aligns with ethical standards and societal norms. Avoid using AI to create harmful or offensive content.

#### 6\. Authenticity and Attribution

If AI-generated art is used in public or commercial contexts, clearly attribute the contribution of the AI artist and respect the transparency in disclosing the involvement of AI in the creative process.

#### 7\. Technical Limitations

Understand the limitations of the AI artist's capabilities and know that it may not always produce perfect or refined results. It's important to consider the context and appropriateness of the generated content.

#### 8\. User Privacy

If the AI artist interacts with users or requires user data, ensure user privacy is protected and data handling complies with relevant regulations and best practices.

#### 9\. Continual Improvement

Keep track of advancements in AI art and regularly update the AI artist's models to benefit from the latest technological developments and improvements.

By paying attention to these considerations, users can make the most of AI artists while maintaining ethical, creative, and responsible use of the technology.
