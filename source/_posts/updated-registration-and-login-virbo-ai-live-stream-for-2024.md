## What Is an AI Text Generator? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. What is an AI text generator?

An AI text generator, also known as a language model, is a software or system that uses artificial intelligence techniques, particularly natural language processing (NLP), to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. Through extensive training on large volumes of text data, these models acquire knowledge of patterns, grammar, and semantics, enabling them to generate cohesive and contextually appropriate text.

Such as OpenAI, AI text generators can produce a wide range of text, including articles, stories, emails, product descriptions, etc. They can be used for various purposes, such as content creation, chatbots, virtual assistants, and even assisting in writing and editing tasks. The generated text aims to mimic human language and can be customized based on prompts or specific requirements.

## Part 2\. What's the working principle of AI text generators?

The AI text generator operates primarily based on deep learning and natural language processing techniques. It uses neural network models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or variants such as extended short-term memory networks (LSTMs) or transformer models.

During the training phase, the AI text generator receives vast text data as input. This data can include books, articles, web pages, conversational records, and more. The model learns natural language patterns by analyzing the statistical characteristics, grammar rules, and semantic associations present in the text data.

The generation of text occurs character by character or word by word. During the generation process, the model predicts the next character or phrase based on the input context and preceding text, ensuring coherence and relevance in the generated output. The objective is to generate text that aligns with the input information and flows naturally.

To enhance the quality of the generated text, AI text generators often undergo extensive pre-training and fine-tuning processes. In the pre-training phase, the model is trained on massive amounts of text data to learn the fundamental features of the language. The model is further adjusted and optimized in the fine-tuning phase through supervised training on specific tasks.

## Part 3\. In which scenarios can AI text generators be applied?

AI text generators can be applied in various scenarios, serving as valuable bridges between different languages, cultures, and industries. They facilitate communication and understanding by providing translations, transcriptions, and interpretations across linguistic and cultural boundaries. This enables global collaboration, cultural exchange, and accessibility to information for diverse audiences.

In addition to bridging gaps, AI text generators find applications in content creation, chatbots and virtual assistants, creative writing, language translation, customer support, social media marketing, personalized recommendations, text summarization, proofreading and editing, research and data analysis, as well as in legal and healthcare sectors. They assist in generating articles, blog posts, product descriptions, and scholarly papers, automate responses, inspire creativity, condense information, aid in drafting legal documents and medical reports, and much more.

As AI text generation technology advances, it opens up new opportunities in journalism, content localization, e-learning, and beyond.

## Part 4\. In using an AI text generator, what should we consider?

AI text generators have promising development prospects and are continuously advancing in their capabilities. However, there are a few key aspects to keep in mind:

#### 1\. Accuracy and Quality

While AI text generators have made significant progress, there can still be generated text that may contain errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. It's important to review and verify the generated content for accuracy and ensure it aligns with your intended message.

#### 2\. Ethical Considerations

AI text generators should be used responsibly, considering ethical implications. The technology can be used maliciously by generating fake news or spreading misinformation. Awareness of the ethical use of AI-generated text is crucial to maintaining trust and credibility.

#### 3\. Domain and Context Specificity

AI text generators may struggle with domain-specific or highly technical content that requires specialized knowledge. While they can generate general text, human experts may still be needed for more complex or nuanced writing tasks.

#### 4\. Intellectual Property and Copyright

When using AI text generators, it's important to be mindful of intellectual property rights and copyright. Some generated text may inadvertently infringe upon existing content, so verifying the originality and uniqueness of the generated output is crucial.

By considering these factors, monitoring advancements in the field, and implementing responsible practices, the development prospects for AI text generators remain promising, enabling us to leverage their capabilities effectively while ensuring ethical and quality outcomes.

 So, let's go through the 8 finest explainer videos and when to employ explanation YouTube video before you start the creation.

## Part 1: What is an Explainer Video?

 Both start-ups and large enterprises employ corporate explainer videos. They are brief videos that highlight the characteristics and advantages of a service or how to utilize a product, and are often featured on website landing pages or in form of SaaS explainer videos. When thinking about making an explainer video for business, there are several of benefits to take into account. It provides your brand a fantastic chance to showcase its identity since it is enjoyable and imaginative.

There are several options when deciding which kind of video is appropriate for you. Here are some of the most well-liked and sensible choices.

## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)
