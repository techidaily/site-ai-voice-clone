## Conclusion

**iPhone talking emoji** , also known as Animoji, is a feature that uses Apple's facial recognition technology to animate emoji characters using the user's facial expressions and voice. This feature was introduced with the iPhone X and has since been expanded to include various emoji characters, including animals, aliens, and even robots.

 Users can record short video messages or take photos with these animated emoji characters and send them to their friends to add a fun touch to their communication. You can also use Wondershare Virbo’s Photo Talking feature to make this**Apple talking emoji** talk from an image.
