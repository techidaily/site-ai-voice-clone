Subtitles play a crucial role in ensuring that viewers from different language backgrounds can enjoy the content. In this section, we will discuss various methods and techniques aimed at enhancing the quality of subtitle translation on Netflix.

Peer review allows translators to receive constructive feedback, identify potential errors or inconsistencies, and refine their translations accordingly. This collaborative approach helps maintain the overall quality of subtitle translations and ensures that the final product meets the highest standards.
