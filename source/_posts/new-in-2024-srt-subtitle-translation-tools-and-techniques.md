## Part 4\. What Are the Characteristics of a Good Translated Video?

 A well-translated video sounds like the original and preserves the content integrity. They can boost your content impression on every streaming platform. In the past, people hired professional translators to get high-quality video content. With the advancements, live video translator replaces manual labor, as you have witnessed above. Now, read this section to know the characteristics of a good, translated video.

* **Fluency and Naturalness:** Viewers can lose interest in the video if it is not translated well. A good, translated video should smoothly play in a natural tone. In this regard, there should not be awkward and literal translations. Plus, the dialogue must seem originally written for the targeted audience.
* **Localization:** As discussed earlier, considering cultural sensitivity means complying with laws. Thus, content should suit the cultural norms and preferences of the viewers. For this purpose, a video must adapt with visuals, references, and chosen language.
* **Subtitle and Dubbing Quality:** No matter what format you are using, the translation must maintain quality. Well-translated video contains well-timed and easy-to-read subtitles. They are properly formatted in the video, while dubbing matches the lip movements.
* **Contextual Understanding:** The first thing you should consider in a video is that it conveys a proper message. The translated video must reflect a deeper understanding of source materials. Also, ensure that the character’s expression, cultural references, and jokes are improved.
* **Technical Quality:** Quality matters a lot, whether it's video quality or translation quality. A good, translated video contains sound quality, resolution, pitch, and speed. Overall, it must preserve all the production values of the video.
