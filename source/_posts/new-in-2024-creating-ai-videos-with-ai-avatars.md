#### Step 5

 Below the language and voice menus, you will see four sliders that allow you to adjust the pitch, speed, volume, and effects of your character’s voice. You can use these sliders to make your character sound more funny or realistic. For example, if you want to make your character sound more high-pitched or low-pitched, you can move the pitch slider to the left or right. If you want to make your character sound more fast or slow, you can move the speed slider to the left or right. If you want to make your character sound more loud or soft, you can move the volume slider to the left or right. If you want to add some effects to your character’s voice, such as echo or reverb, you can move the effects slider to the left or right.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-5.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-5.jpg)

#### Step 6

 Below the sliders, you will see a box where you can type or paste your text that you want your character to say aloud. You can use up to 1000 characters per request for this box. You can also use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags to add some pauses, emphasis, or other effects to your speech. SSML is a standard way of controlling how text is spoken by a speech synthesizer. You can use SSML tags by enclosing them in angle brackets (< >). For example, if you want to add a pause of half a second between two words, you can use the tag <break time=“500ms”/> between them. If you want to add some emphasis on a word or phrase, you can use the tag <emphasis> around them.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-6.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-6.jpg)

#### Step 7

 After you type or paste your text in the box, you can click on the “Say It” button below it to hear your character speak your text aloud. You will also see your character’s expressions and movements change according to your text. For example, if your text contains some punctuation marks or emoticons, such as ! ? :) :( etc., your character will show some corresponding emotions and gestures on their face and body.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg)

## Demystifying AI Game Generators | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. Explanation of what AI game generators are

An AI game generator is a cutting-edge software or system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automate and enhance various aspects of game development. It harnesses the power of machine learning, neural networks, and other AI methodologies to create, design, or assist in the creation of video games. Unlike traditional game development methods that heavily rely on manual design and coding, AI game generators offer a more automated and efficient approach.

## Part 2\. How do AI game generators differ from traditional game development methods?

AI game generators differ significantly from traditional game development methods in several key ways

### 1\. Automation and Efficiency

AI game generators automate various aspects of game development, such as content creation and level design, reducing the need for manual work.  
Traditional methods involve manual coding and design, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

### 2\. Speed of Development

AI game generators can rapidly generate game content and prototypes, speeding up development.  
Traditional methods may require extensive coding, design, and testing, leading to longer development cycles.

### 3\. Creativity and Innovation

AI game generators can introduce novel and unexpected elements by analyzing existing game data and patterns.  
Traditional methods use human creativity to design characters, levels, and gameplay mechanics.

### 4\. Personalization and Dynamic Content

AI game generators enable dynamic and personalized experiences by generating content based on player interactions.  
Traditional methods provide static content that's designed and coded beforehand.

### 5\. Resource Constraints

AI game generators can help smaller teams or indie developers overcome resource limitations by automating various tasks.  
Traditional methods require a larger team and more resources to create content and code from scratch.

### 6\. Iteration and Prototyping

AI game generators allow for rapid iteration and prototyping, enabling developers to test and refine ideas quickly.  
Traditional methods involve manual iteration and can be slower adapting to changes.

### 7\. Diverse Content Creation

AI game generators can produce various content variations, enhancing replayability and game diversity.  
Due to time and resource constraints, traditional methods may result in limited content.

### 8\. Human Expertise

AI game generators complement human expertise by automating routine tasks, freeing developers to focus on creative and strategic decisions.  
Traditional methods require developers to design, code, and implement every game element manually.

### 9\. Learning and Adaptation

AI game generators can learn from player behavior and adapt gameplay elements accordingly.  
Traditional methods rely on developers manually adjusting game elements based on feedback.

While AI game generators offer numerous advantages regarding efficiency, speed, and innovation, it's important to recognize that they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. They excel in automating certain tasks and enhancing creativity, but they are most effective when used with human expertise to create well-balanced and engaging gaming experiences.
