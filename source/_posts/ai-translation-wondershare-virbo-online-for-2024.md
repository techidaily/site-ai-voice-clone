## Bonus Tips: Try the Best Alternative to Voicemod AI - Virbo

 Voicemod might stand out as one of the best voice-changing software around. But, this program has a few drawbacks, primarily complex usability. Also, Voicemod only works with audio files and live microphone recordings. This begs the question: what if you want to add a voice effect to a video and share it online?

 In that case, [Wondershare Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/)  is the best alternative to Voicemod AI. With this AI-backed desktop program, you can create video templates with 150+ free avatars and 120+ voiceovers. It’s the best tool for creating videos with unique voice effects for digital marketing, online classes, tutorials, and other uses. This tool also supports tens of languages and can convert texts to audio overlays.

 Follow these steps to create a video with AI voiceover on Wondershare Virbo:

**Step 1.** Download and install Wondershare Virbo on your PC, then click the**Avatar** button. The installation process should take just a few seconds.
