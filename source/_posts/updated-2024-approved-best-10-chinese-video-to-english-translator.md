### 2.**What is the best free celebrity voice generator?**

 There are many things to look for in the best**free celebrity voice generator** . First and foremost, an AI voice generator tool must allow you to create voices in multiple tones and languages. Also, it should be simple to use and offer several customization options, like adding subtitles, stickers, background effects, and more. Use Virbo to enjoy all these features and more.

### 3. **Are AI-generated celebrity voices different from human impersonators?**

 Human impersonators can give excellent results for celebrity voices. However, getting an impersonator to generate celebrity voices for TikTok or other social apps can be time-consuming and expensive. AI celebrity voice generators are easier to find and cost-friendly. In addition, you can get multiple celebrity voices in a single program.
