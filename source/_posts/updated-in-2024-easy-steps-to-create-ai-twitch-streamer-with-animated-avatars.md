So how does it work?

### 01 How does TikTok Live Studio work?

 Being a comprehensive live streaming software, creators who want to use Live Studio will need to at least have 1000 followers to unlock and access this wonderful software. TikTok LIVE Studio has helped gaming creators up their TikTok Live experience, experience true monetization, and connect deeply with their viewers.

 However, if you want to be a gaming-related creator, you must have posted game-related short videos or gone live while playing a game of your choice. But with non-gamers, the policy is different. You need at least 10,000 followers to have access to the LIVE Studio.

### 02 Benefits and Features of TikTok Live Studio

**Tik Tok LIVE Studio** provides many features that make streaming a breeze. Especially when you are a gamer, you get so many intuitive controls that it turns your TikTok into an analytical dashboard where you can understand your audience a bit better.

 Secondly, you can engage with viewers like a pro using streaming-oriented features like LIVE, LIVE Goal, Highlight, and more. It sets up a whole system for you to follow and improve, allowing you to take your streaming career to the next level.

 Moreover, with TikTok LIVE Studio, you can also chat with your viewers through an in-game chatbox. From reacting to their comments and receiving gifts, Live Studio provides all the options for streamers to leverage.
