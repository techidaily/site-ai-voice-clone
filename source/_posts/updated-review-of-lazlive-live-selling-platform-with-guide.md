## How To Perform a Successful Streaming on Twitch

 Live streaming has become a regular source of enjoyment for many people in recent years, especially on a platform like Twitch. In the first quarter of 2023 alone, Twitch users watched[over 5.3 billion hours](https://backlinko.com/twitch-users) of video.

 If you’re a content creator, you should definitely consider leveraging this power of Twitch video streaming, as it tends to have higher levels of engagement compared to pre-recorded content. But with so many Twitch streamers out there, standing out from the crowd can be challenging.

 If you’re new to the scene, we can help you start your Twitch streaming journey off right with the right gear and some useful tips.

![Live stream on Twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Essential Preparations Before Beginning Your Twitch Streaming Journey

 Whether you're playing games, hosting events, or just chatting, streaming on Twitch is an exciting and rewarding way to engage with your audience in real-time. But to do well on Twitch, you need to prepare properly so your viewers can enjoy watching your content.

To start streaming on Twitch, here's what you'll need:

### Twitch Streaming Software

 First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.

1. **OBS Studio**

 OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.

1. **Twitch Studio**

 Twitch Studio is the official free streaming application developed to simplify the streaming process for new streamers on Twitch. It offers an intuitive interface and pre-made scenes designed to streamline the user experience.

### Streaming equipment

1. **A device to stream from**

 To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you'll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.

 If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:

* **CPU**

 When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.

* **GPU or graphic cards**

 Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU's workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.

1. **Microphone**

 Although you might get by using a gaming headset's built-in microphone for a bit, it's better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.

1. **Webcam**

 If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.

 You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.
