In this regard, there should not be awkward and literal translations. Plus, the dialogue must seem originally written for the targeted audience.

* **Technical Quality:** Quality matters a lot, whether it's video quality or translation quality. A good, translated video contains sound quality, resolution, pitch, and speed. Overall, it must preserve all the production values of the video.
