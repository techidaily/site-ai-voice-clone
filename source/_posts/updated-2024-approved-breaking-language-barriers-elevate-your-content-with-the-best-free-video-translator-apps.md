## Part 2: Why are Subtitles Important in Video Content?

 Subtitles are important for video content, as they enhance the overall experience. They act as a helping aid in multiple situations, environments, and more. This section of the reading elaborates on the advantages of subtitles below:

1. **Inclusivity and Accessibility:** Primarily, subtitles make content available to a broader audience. Whether anyone is facing a hearing loss or hearing impairment, they can still read. In scenes where non-native audiences cannot understand speech, they are a savior. In video lectures or tutorials, subtitles enhance the audience's comprehension.
2. **Multilingual Translation:** An increased understanding of disabled audiences’ aids in multilingual support. When you generate subtitles for a video, you can transform it into other languages. Later, you can use text-to-speech converters to generate multilingual speech.
3. **Improved SEO Performance:** You must have been aware of SEO and its ranking policies. Subtitles double your video’s SEO ranking and overall performance. Hence, adding subtitles can help the audience find your video on top search results. This is a valuable marketing tactic for content creators and brands working online.
4. **Noise-Sensitive Environments:** As lives become demanding, the time of leisure limits every day. Students and professionals entertain themselves during their travel time. However, these environments, like traffic, libraries, and offices, are noise-sensitive. This is where subtitles help with content comprehension when you cannot hear.
5. **Improved Learning:** People try to learn multiple languages via video content. Subtitles help them with better comprehension by engaging both audio and visual senses. The audience also has a visual representation of spoken language for quick learning. They also clarify any misunderstandings of dialogues and maintain consistency.
6. **Legal Requirements:** In some regions, adding subtitles is a legal requirement. For instance, communist nations make them compulsory for their disabled audience. Thus, instead of hiring editors or translators, video speech-to-text converters online are preferable.

## Part 3: How Well Has AI Adapted to Converting Video Content into Text?

 In the past, the procedure to**translate video audio to text**  was quite complex. It changed with the advancement of automatic speech recognition and natural language processing. The integration of these ASRs and NLPs made AI technology more adaptable. Here is an extensive review of how AI has revolutionized to convert video audio to text:
