 Twitter has limited features in terms of translation. Currently, Twitter only allows the translation of text within tweets. There are no built-in features for translating video content directly on the platform. But, you can enable closed captions to aid in understanding video content.

Here are the steps to turn on closed captions videos on Twitter:

* **Step 1.** Open the Twitter app or website and find the video tweet that you want to watch with closed captions. This tweet could be in your timeline or a user's profile.
* **Step 2.** Tap the video's thumbnail to play the video.
* **Step 3.** Tap on the three dots at the top right of the screen to bring up the video player controls.

![Twitter’s video playback](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-2.jpeg)

* **Step 4.** Look for the closed captions (CC) icon on the video player controls. It usually appears as a small icon with the letters "Captions" or "CC" inside a rectangle. Tap on this icon to turn on closed captions.

![Turn on Captions](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-3.jpeg)

* **Step 5.** Once closed captions are enabled, watch the video as usual. You should see text at the bottom of the screen that provides a written transcription of the audio content.

 However, closed captions on Twitter are not perfect. Not every video on Twitter shows this feature. That's why this feature is not a popular option for many users.
