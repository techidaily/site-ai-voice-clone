We will review these apps based on their key attributes and the ability to generate varying AI voices. Keep scrolling!

## **Part 1\. Why do you need AI voice changers?**

 First, let’s start by listing some reasons why you need an AI voice changer app. As mentioned, there are many reasons to use an AI-powered voice changer as this program can unlock endless possibilities.

* **Entertainment and fun:** Are your friends often pranking you with videos and audio recordings? You can score one against them by recording a prank audio or video using an AI voice changer tool.
* **Content creator:** Are you a content creator on YouTube, TikTok, Reels, and other platforms? You can use AI voice to create high-quality content with fun and engaging narrations. AI voices can also help create top-quality podcasts.
