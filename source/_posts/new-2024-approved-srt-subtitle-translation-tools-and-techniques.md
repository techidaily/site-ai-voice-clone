This way, you free up your time to do more important tasks than being a translator!

If you just want to see how things work, any of those options is going to serve as a good measure. However, when you want to**translate SRT** subtitles online in a more professional way wherein your reputation and image are on the line, you want the best of the best. Here is how to choose just the right online subtitle translation tool for you.

#### 3.1: Ease of Use

 How easy is an online subtitle translation software to use? Most online SRT translation tools boast a simple, 3-step process. You will not find much variance here, because it is just a simple upload, translate, and download process.

#### 3.2: Editing Features

 Online SRT subtitles translator software may provide you with editing features. These editing features can be used to differentiate between products and are worth looking into. If one online editor does not have something that the other offers, clearly the other is your tool, other factors notwithstanding.

#### 3.3: Format Support

 Most software to**translate SRT online** support a number of subtitle formats. However, one or two might not support the format you want to use, so check the number of formats supported before using an online tool to translate SRT subtitles.

 The world of text-to-speech conversions has revolutionized in recent years. Gone are the days when your speech sounded robotic and monotonous. Today, these tools can perfect all the distinctions of various accents and languages.

 If you want to dive into the world of**English accent voice generators** , you have landed on the right article. Finding a tool that captures all the details of regional accents might be overwhelming. Keep reading to discover the leading platforms to help you in this regard.

## Part 1: How Many English Accents are Available All Over The World

 English has become one of the most commonly recognized languages around the world. Many countries across the globe speak English as a first or second language. The diversity of English language accents lies specifically in this fact. This is also proof of the language’s adaptability and rich cultural history.

 Assigning an exact number to the English accents spoken globally is challenging. Accents vary greatly with regions. Sometimes even the same city can produce multiple accents of the same language. Yet, linguists suggest that an estimated 160 accents exist in the English language worldwide. While it is difficult to touch all the different accents in one sitting, here are some commonly spoken ones:

1. Received Pronunciation
2. Yorkshire
3. Scottish
4. Welsh
5. Cockney
6. Irish
7. Southern American
8. Australian
9. Canadian
10. South African

## Part 2: What Are The Reasons Behind Different English Accents

 Several factors contribute to the incredible diversity found in the English language. A range of features can influence accents, some of which include the following:

### 1\. Migration, Travel, and Settlements

 Throughout history, the world has seen many languages spread across the world. Travel has always been one of the primary reasons. Isolated communities often develop distinct accents due to limited interactions. More commonly, English-speaking populations have migrated and settled in various regions, blending the local language and native English accents. Due to this mixing, new and unique accents emerge.

### 2\. Colonization and Imperialism

 The British Empire's expansion era resulted in several colonial settlements. As a result, English was spread to numerous territories and far-off places in the world. The amalgamation of English with local languages and dialects gave rise to unique accents such as Indian and African English.

### 3\. Media and Entertainment

 Media has always been a powerful communication and a great way to spread your word. People often copy speech patterns observed in mainstream media and entertainment. These include movies, TV shows, and music. This can lead to the development of certain distinct accents and dialects. This particularly occurs in regions that have high media exposure.

### 4\. Education and Socioeconomic Factors

 Certain accents have been associated with distinct socioeconomic factors. Higher levels of education are often associated with more standardized and prestigious accents. Other influences such as occupation, social identity, and community also play a key role in determining the varying accents of individuals.

### 5\. Linguistic Drifts and Age

 Linguistic drift is a natural process that helps languages evolve. Like most languages, English has also undergone linguistic drift. This phenomenon has caused notable changes in various language features. These changes can be of phonological and grammatical nature. As a result, several variations have occurred in accents and dialects.
