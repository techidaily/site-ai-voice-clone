Here is how to choose just the right online subtitle translation tool for you.

#### 3.1: Ease of Use

#### 3.2: Editing Features

If one online editor does not have something that the other offers, clearly the other is your tool, other factors notwithstanding.

#### 3.3: Format Support

 Most software to**translate SRT online** support a number of subtitle formats. However, one or two might not support the format you want to use, so check the number of formats supported before using an online tool to translate SRT subtitles.
