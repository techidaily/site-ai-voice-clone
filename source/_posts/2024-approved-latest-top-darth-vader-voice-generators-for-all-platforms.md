 The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

 Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.

With talking photos, not only do you have a memory as image, but you can have the memory with voice and video to make it more life-like. In some uses, this can be deeply comforting to us.

#### 1.1: Uses of Talking Photos

 What can talking photos be used for? Talking photos can be used for fun as well as for interactive education. Here are some uses of talking photos, in a gist:

* An interactive and more engaging learning experience for children.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

## Part 3\. Tips for Writing Prompts To Generate Videos From Text

 The key to**creating AI videos from text** is a good prompt. Unlike text-to-image generators, creating video prompts needs greater detail and clarity. With a good prompt, you can effectively guide the AI model in understanding the desired visual elements, narrative structure, and emotional context of the video.

 Here, we list a few tips to create good prompts for generating videos from text:

1. **Provide context**

 When crafting your AI video prompt, include specific information such as desired style, target audience, intended platform for posting (e.g., YouTube), and preferred tone (e.g., casual or formal). You can also indicate if you want high-definition video, like 4K videos.

1. **Be clear and specific**

 Although providing details is important, avoid unnecessary things that could confuse AI text-to-video generators. Keep your prompt clear and focused to ensure the AI understands your instructions accurately.

1. **Use descriptive language**

 Given that the AI will transform your text into videos, use descriptive language to depict characters, settings, actions, and objects vividly. This will help the AI create a more accurate representation of your vision.

1. **Incorporate keywords**

 Some AI video prompt platforms may support the use of tags or keywords to help generate video according to our intent. Use these keywords to influence the AI's output effectively.

1. **Structure the prompt effectively**

 Organize your prompt in a logical manner to ensure clarity and coherence. Start with an introductory sentence that summarizes the main idea or theme of the video. Then, break down the key elements or scenes you want to include.

 Moreover, pay attention to scene transitions. In case you need multiple scenes, make sure they transition smoothly to maintain a coherent flow when**generating videos from text** .

 Learning the right strategy for making talking head videos is essential. A high-quality video helps to deliver a message precisely without distraction. Here are some authentic tips that help you understand**how to make talking head videos more interesting** and professional:

#### 1\. Plan the Script for Your Video

 Going anywhere without preparation is always a disaster; the same goes for creating videos. You should make a rough outline with a concise subject. The video's intent should be clear so you can deliver it to the right audience. Also, pre-planning can help to craft a professional script and shoot videos accordingly.

#### 2\. Adjust Lighting for a Better View

 Lighting plays a pivotal role in shooting videos. So, you should focus on lighting adjustments and clarity. Also, you need to avoid overexposure, harsh shadows, and lousy lighting resources. You can also use natural light that doesn’t throw shadows.

#### 3\. Improve Audio Quality

 Undoubtedly, audio is half of your content and delivers your message to the audience. Therefore, low audio quality is unacceptable when creating professional**talking head videos.** Using a camera microphone might not be a good choice as it doesn’t provide high quality. Therefore, you can use a lapel or boom mic to enhance voice quality.

#### 4\. Make Your Setup Decent

 You can work on your setup to make your videos more professional and exciting. Your environment reflects a picture of the viewers' minds. Making your setup look better is a good strategy for engagement. For this purpose, you can use some visually appealing props in your room.

#### 5\. Use Two Cameras or More

 You can try shooting videos from different angles with more than one camera. This dynamic video looks interesting to viewers, so they can boost engagement. With this advance, you get more flexibility to adjust each frame. Moreover, you can also use this technique to make your video creative and professional.

#### 6\. Make Use of AI Tools
