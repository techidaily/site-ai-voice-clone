Here are the seven best whiteboard animation videos so you can get an idea of which choice suits your business the best:

### 1.[Oxfam](https://youtube/wuDQIjGRCfg.com)

 Whiteboard animation may still be effective whether it's for entertainment, marketing, or education. But it's also capable of addressing weightier issues. This describes the situation with the Oxfam International video. Raising awareness of the predicament of women worldwide is the task they confront.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-oxfam.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-oxfam.jpg)

### 2. [Unilever Series](https://youtu.be/qw6Vuz70tZE)

 Despite the fun and enjoyable material, Unilever uses the ads to convey a serious message: there is a need for men's hair and skin care. This is a fantastic illustration of how an animated whiteboard can be utilized to boost engagement and foster customer loyalty. The short, hilarious, and emotional videos are all three. An observer observes one and desires to observe others.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-unilever.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-unilever.jpg)

### 3.[Where Good Ideas Come from:](https://youtu.be/NugRZGDbPFU)

 This video addresses Steven Johnson's Where Good Ideas Come From, which examines the history of invention, using the conventional hand-drawn whiteboard format. What's important to note is that the video was specifically made to explain the fundamental thesis of the book and is not in any way self-promotional. This is echoed in the last frame of the illustration, as the camera pans out to show us the whole artwork.

![whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg)

 The capacity of whiteboard videos to simplify a difficult procedure is what distinguishes them from other animated explainer videos. The way that this specific video develops is fascinating. Since they are presented as logically related to one another, the concepts flow consistently and are simple to understand. As a result, we are motivated to read more of the book, which supports the assumption that the concepts being presented are part of a system.

### 4.[Content 2020 by Coca Cola](https://youtu.be/LyDf-twhpCo)

It is the ideal illustration of the rule that the longer your video, the more devoted your audience must be.
