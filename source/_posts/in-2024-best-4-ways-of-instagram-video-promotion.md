#### Step 3 Upload You Video

---

![ai generate video script](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/guide/app/video-translate-app-6.png)

A pop-up page will appear, and you must follow the prompts to get started with your video translation! Before uploading your original video file, here are some tips you must bear in mind:

1. The recommended video duration and format is a 10s-2min MP4 file.
2. Uploaded videos should contain authentic voices. The translation function is only affected by human voices.
3. Video translation only supports voiceover content. You can not translate the songs or any BGM in the video.
4. Avoid any background noise or music, as they can reduce the quality of the audio output.
5. The video resolution must be between 480x480 and 1920x1920.

#### Step 4 Select Desired Language

![ai generate video script](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/guide/app/video-translate-app-7.png)

Likewise, if you want to **keep the original BGM**, please turn this feature on.

By following these steps, you can quickly start your video translation. The video translation process will take some time, and at the same time, you can continue with your new video creation.

#### Step 6 Export Translated Video

Once you are satisfied with the effect of the whole video, click “**Export**” to generate the video. In this way, a brand new video using Virbo AI avatar is created.

Mainly for educational content, it can be made more accessible to a broader audience. Language courses, lectures, and tutorials can be translated, making it easier for students and learners to access valuable information in their native languages.

Moreover, **AI video translation** is generally more cost-effective and faster than traditional human translation services. It can quickly process and translate large volumes of video content.
