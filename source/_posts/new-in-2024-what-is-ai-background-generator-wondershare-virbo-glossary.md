This is echoed in the last frame of the illustration, as the camera pans out to show us the whole artwork.

![whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg)

The animation describes Coca-Cola's new approach and emphasizes providing content that is relevant, worthwhile, and shareable. To convey the company's message, the scenes in this

### 5.[MedVector](https://youtu.be/p5LnKLRrz7M)

 MedVector employees make use of the whiteboard format to instruct visitors on how their product might benefit the clinical trial business. The video explains the service's many features and demonstrates how easy it is to use.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-medvector.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-medvector.jpg)

 Compared to the other videos we've seen, this one is a little different. It doesn't concentrate on a certain plot, despite the animated characters that give it charm. Instead, it addresses the issue at hand—how to obtain participants for medical trials—head-on. This kind of animation engages viewers by allowing them to concentrate on the key elements of your solution.
