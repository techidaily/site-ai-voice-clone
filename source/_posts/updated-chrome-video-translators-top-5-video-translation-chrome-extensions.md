## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

### 4\. LiveNewsMag

![LiveNewsMag](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-4.jpg)

[LiveNewsMag](https://www.livenewsmag.com/msnbc-news-live-stream/) has one of the prettiest website designs and it allows you to watch MSNBC Live for free. However, there’s a catch. You will need to experience ads since the website won’t even work even if you have an ad blocker installed and activated.

 However, you can join LiveNewsPro which will disable ads for your particular account on the platform. LiveNewsMag provides one of the fastest loading times and although you will be greeted with ads from time to time, you are still getting live news on MSNBC right in the LiveNewsMag platform.

### 5\. FreeInterTV

![FreeInterTV](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-5.jpg)

[FreeInterTV](http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2565) is an all-in-one package that also displays MSNBC news online. It is a great platform and a free alternative to the original website. However, the magic of this platform is that it provides you with most TV channels from all across the world.

 The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

 Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.

#### Features

| **Aspects**         | Performance                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |

| **Quality**         | Up to 720p (HD) but usually 480p |
| **User Experience** | Confusing design                 |
