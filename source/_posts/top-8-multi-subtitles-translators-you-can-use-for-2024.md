Here is how to choose just the right online subtitle translation tool for you.

#### 3.1: Ease of Use

## Conclusion

 Gone are the days when you had to make separate videos for every language you wanted your videos to be in and had to hire linguists to proofread and check your subtitle files in case you were using subtitles in different languages for your videos. Today, you can auto translate subtitles online using any of the freely available online SRT translation tools. However, this guide shows you how to select the right tool for you, and as bonus, gives you an easy-to-use tool to translate videos into any language easily!
