## What Is an AI Artist? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## **Part 1\. What is an AI artist?**

AI artist refers to an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to create art autonomously or assist human artists in their creative process. AI artists use machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to analyze and understand patterns in existing artworks and generate new art based on that knowledge.

Some AI artists can create paintings, drawings, or digital art, while others can generate music, poetry, or video content. They work by learning from a vast dataset of existing artworks or creative content and then producing original pieces that mimic the style, themes, or elements present in those examples.

AI artists are not meant to replace human creativity but rather to augment it and inspire new ideas. They can be valuable tools for artists to experiment with different styles, generate concepts, or overcome creative blocks. AI art is continually evolving, and the creations of AI artists often spark discussions about the intersection of technology and creativity in the art world.

## **Part 2\. Guidelines for responsible use of AI artists**

When utilizing AI artists, it is essential to consider the following factors:

#### 1\. Data and Copyright

Ensure that the AI artist's training data and the generated content do not violate copyright or intellectual property rights. Make sure to use properly licensed datasets and obtain permission when using copyrighted materials as inputs.

#### 2\. Bias and Fairness

AI artists learn from existing data, and if the data contains biases, it may reflect in the generated content. Be cautious of any biases present in the training data and take steps to mitigate or address them to ensure fairness and inclusivity in the generated art.

#### 3\. Creative Input

While AI artists can be helpful tools, it's essential to maintain the artist's creative input and not rely solely on AI-generated content. AI should be seen as a collaborator or a source of inspiration rather than a substitute for human creativity.

#### 4\. Experimentation and Exploration

Use AI artists to explore new artistic styles, techniques, and ideas. Embrace the experimental nature of AI-generated art and push the boundaries of creativity with technology.

#### 5\. Ethical Use

Be mindful of the content generated by AI artists and ensure that it aligns with ethical standards and societal norms. Avoid using AI to create harmful or offensive content.

#### 6\. Authenticity and Attribution

If AI-generated art is used in public or commercial contexts, clearly attribute the contribution of the AI artist and respect the transparency in disclosing the involvement of AI in the creative process.

#### 7\. Technical Limitations

Understand the limitations of the AI artist's capabilities and know that it may not always produce perfect or refined results. It's important to consider the context and appropriateness of the generated content.

#### 8\. User Privacy

If the AI artist interacts with users or requires user data, ensure user privacy is protected and data handling complies with relevant regulations and best practices.

#### 9\. Continual Improvement

Keep track of advancements in AI art and regularly update the AI artist's models to benefit from the latest technological developments and improvements.

By paying attention to these considerations, users can make the most of AI artists while maintaining ethical, creative, and responsible use of the technology.

## Must-Read: Learn From Deepfake Scandals & Protect Your Stream

 Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) tools have significantly influenced various industries, including streaming services. In the recent wave of development,**deepfake streamers** have emerged as a way of replicating people in videos. Creators are also using**deepfake live streams** to engage viewers with avatars that look just like their favorite celebs. However, deepfake streams often encounter attacks and issues that may question their authenticity. In this article, we look at some of the hacks creators can use to beat deepfake attacks.

## Part 1: What is Deepfake Scandals?

 Deepfake scandals involve incidents when media is manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI) in unethical or harmful ways.

![deepface scandals](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/5-must-know-hacks-to-beat-deepfake-attacks-streamer-survival-guide-1.jpg)

Some of the issues included in the Deepfake scandals include:

1. **Misinformation and Disinformation:** Creation of misleading and false videos or audio recordings of public figures, which helps to sway public opinion and influence elections.
2. **Financial Fraud:** Impersonating someone to gain access to their financial accounts and other personal information.
3. **Nonconsensual Deepfake Pornography:** Superimposing an individual’s face or body onto another’s in sexually explicit content without their consent.
4. **Cyberbullying and harassment:** Creating humiliating or embarrassing videos of an individual to harass or cyberbully them.

## Part 2: Must-read Tips for Deepfake Streamers

 The rise of deepfake content has caught the eyes of many regulatory agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The major concern is the use of deepfakes for crimes like blackmail, extortion, and harassment. With several scandals also pegged to deepfake, streamers need to be conscious of how they use this technology. Here are 5 must-read pieces of advice concerning deepfakes.

### **1\.** **Choose Your Content Wisely**

 Although the power of deepfakes is undeniable, creatives can overcome it by choosing content wisely. To be on the safe side, avoid content that treads on sensitive ground. Stay away from topics that spread misinformation, and avoid engaging in malicious humor or issues that involve impersonating real people without their consent. You may be considering using fictional narratives, original characters, or transformative works that push the boundaries of storytelling. Try to be more creative and imaginative in your work while staying within the ethical frameworks.

### **2\.** **Be Transparent in Your Work**

 Streamers are often carried away by the buzz or the need to stay in the spotlight. However, being honest and transparent will help you stay authentic with your audience. Right from the onset, try to be as upfront with your views as possible about the use of deepfakes. By being open about your creative journey, you will be enhancing rather than spoiling the magic.

 The way you represent deepfakes to your audience means everything. Announce your personas clearly and explain the technology behind the creation. Use the opportunity to build trust with your audience and engage them in intriguing conversations about the nature of identity and digital representations. Doing so can also help spark more interest among the audience as they realize that they are interacting with a meticulously crafted avatar and not a celebrity clone.

### **3\.** **Label and Contextualize**

 When you are using deepfakes for streaming, treat your viewer like an intelligent companion. Avoid the mistake of seeing them as gullible marks. Make sure your content is clearly labeled as deepfake through titles, overlays, or disclaimers in your stream. Show that you care about your audience and you do not want to leave them guessing. Explain the purpose behind your chosen person and the creative choices that you have made.

### **4\.** **Prioritize Respect Over Reach**

 Deepfakes allow you to instantly explore fame and what people think of your avatar. However, avoid being carried away by the fame and being swayed to the unethical side. Steer clear of impersonation that can lead to reputational damage or harm vulnerable groups. Even if your avatar is just a fictional character, it still deserves ethical treatment. If it engaged in potential offensive behavior, make sure it is within the confines of your established narrative.

### **5\.** **Embrace the Collaborative Spirit**

 Deepfake streamlining has great potential for community building. You can easily collaborate with other creators by engaging in open discussions and encouraging responsible use of the technology. Working together with other creators also helps you to share knowledge and troubleshoot challenges together. You also get to elevate your content while contributing to a healthier and more responsible deepfake ecosystem.

## Bonus - A Safe Choice for Live Streaming:[Virbo Live](https://virbo.wondershare.com/virbo-live.html)

 Whether you are a content creator or a brand, you can benefit from the power of AI in your content. With Deepfake scandals having such ethical issues, finding a safe option is essential.
