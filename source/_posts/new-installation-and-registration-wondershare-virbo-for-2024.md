Step 4 Download Translated Subtitles

 The Cat subtitle translate is often quick and takes only a few seconds for the tools to generate subtitles in the requested language. Once the translation process is complete, download your new subtitle file for your video. The file contains the subtitles for your video file. However, you will need the .srt file, the video file, and a video player to view it. Add the .srt vile to your video player (VLC, Movie and TV app in Widows, or video player in Mac). This will display the new subtitles when you play the video.
