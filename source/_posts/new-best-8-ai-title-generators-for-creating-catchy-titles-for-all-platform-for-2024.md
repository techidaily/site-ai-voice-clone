### 2\. Speed of Development

AI game generators can rapidly generate game content and prototypes, speeding up development.  
Traditional methods may require extensive coding, design, and testing, leading to longer development cycles.

### 3\. Creativity and Innovation

Traditional methods provide static content that's designed and coded beforehand.

### 5\. Resource Constraints
