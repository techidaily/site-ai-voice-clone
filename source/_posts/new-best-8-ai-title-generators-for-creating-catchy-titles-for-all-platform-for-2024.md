##### Step 2 Generate the Script

 Start writing your script to generate lifelike voices. However, if you want to write a script yourself, press “Enter.” In contrast, if you want to get an AI-generated script, choose the “Ask AI to Write” option.

##### Step 3 Employ AI to Polish Your Script

 After clicking this button, a dialog box will appear on the screen. Now, write what you want AI to do in the prompt box and select the “Enter” key. You can specify your output of a whole script, an outline, or brainstorming ideas for your content. Moreover, you can ask AI to refine the result to get the required answer. Finally, choose the “Add to Script” option to use it for your videos.

You can opt for the “Browse Stock AI Speakers” to choose among the speakers offered by the tool. Later, navigate to the bottom of the screen and tap on the “Play” icon to preview the recording.
