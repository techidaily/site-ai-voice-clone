#### Limitations

* **Coqui TTS voice cloning** and other features of this tool take too much time to process files.
* Other than that, the XTTS version of this tool is slower than their core TTS technology. It is still an underdeveloped platform, which contains some bugs or compatibility issues.
* Users need to learn the XTTS coding language for this tool before using any of its advanced features.
* This deep learning tool for speech cloning requires a lot of data processing resources to run.

## Part 3: Master Coqui TTS Voice Cloning: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Imagine that you are a short-film producer who does not have many voice actors for their movie. What you should use is the **Coqui TTS Voice Cloning** feature to produce impressive voices. Thus, let's discover what steps to take to create a perfect cloned voice:

##### Step 1 Access the Tool

First, launch [Hugging Face's](https://huggingface.co/) official website to initiate the process. Then, hit the “Spaces” tab from the above toolbar and search for Coqui. Afterward, select the "[CoquiTTS (Official)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/coqui/CoquiTTS)" tool uploaded by Coqui and access its interface.

##### Step 2 Convert Text to Speech

##### Step 3 Clone Your Own Voice

You can upload a preferably 6-second audio recording in the interface as a reference audio simply by dragging and dropping. You can even record it directly using the “Record a microphone" button if you don't have a recording file.
