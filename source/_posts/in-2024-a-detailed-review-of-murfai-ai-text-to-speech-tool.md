 Create a personalized Q&A database for your AI streamer to connect more naturally with your audience. This feature allows you to set up automatic responses to questions, ensuring your viewers feel valued.

#### 6\. Microphone Integration for Voice-Driven AI

 Get your AI-powered avatar to speak in real time by connecting and speaking into the microphone. What you speak into the microphone is automatically replicated by the AI streamer during the event.

#### 7\. Interaction Through Text

 Trigger and get your AI streamer to speak based on your own written text. You only need to enter the text that you want and click Send. The AI streamer will then speech what you have typed.

#### 8\. Cloud-Based Operation

 Virbo Live offers you more freedom with the cloud-based operation. All the features are available online, and you do not have to struggle downloading any software. Operate directly from the cloud and freely manage your product.

## Conclusion

 TalkShopLive offers sellers and shoppers a unique experience to sell and buy products during live shows. The platform is specially designed to help in the distribution, collaboration, and sharing of a truly shoppable and social video experience.

 As a social-selling network, Talk Shop Live allows users to interact with each other and make informed purchase decisions. However, hiring a human streamer and preparing their content can be time-consuming and expensive. That’s why we recommend [Virbo Live](https://virbo.wondershare.com/virbo-live.html) as the future of live-stream shopping. Get access to AI-powered avatars that will keep your viewers engaged while boosting your revenue from live-stream events.
