**Content Analysis:** The AI algorithms analyze the input content, including text and multimedia elements, to understand its context, key points, and keywords.

**Design Suggestions:** Based on the content analysis, the AI presentation maker generates design suggestions, such as layout options, font styles, color schemes, and relevant imagery. These suggestions aim to enhance the presentation's visual impact and overall aesthetics.

**Automated Slide Generation:** Once the design suggestions are provided, the AI presentation maker automatically generates slides by incorporating the selected design elements and arranging the content visually appealingly. It ensures a cohesive flow throughout the presentation.

**Customization and Editing:** Users can further customize the generated slides by modifying the design elements, adding or removing content, and adjusting the layout according to their preferences. The AI tool adapts to these modifications and maintains the overall coherence of the presentation.
