## Part 1: How Many English Accents are Available All Over The World

 English has become one of the most commonly recognized languages around the world. Many countries across the globe speak English as a first or second language. The diversity of English language accents lies specifically in this fact. This is also proof of the language’s adaptability and rich cultural history.

 Assigning an exact number to the English accents spoken globally is challenging. Accents vary greatly with regions. Sometimes even the same city can produce multiple accents of the same language. Yet, linguists suggest that an estimated 160 accents exist in the English language worldwide. While it is difficult to touch all the different accents in one sitting, here are some commonly spoken ones:

4. Welsh
5. Cockney
6. Irish
7. Southern American
8. Australian
9. Canadian

## Part 2: What Are The Reasons Behind Different English Accents

 Several factors contribute to the incredible diversity found in the English language. A range of features can influence accents, some of which include the following:

### 1\. Migration, Travel, and Settlements

 Throughout history, the world has seen many languages spread across the world. Travel has always been one of the primary reasons. Isolated communities often develop distinct accents due to limited interactions. More commonly, English-speaking populations have migrated and settled in various regions, blending the local language and native English accents. Due to this mixing, new and unique accents emerge.

### 2\. Colonization and Imperialism

 The British Empire's expansion era resulted in several colonial settlements. As a result, English was spread to numerous territories and far-off places in the world. The amalgamation of English with local languages and dialects gave rise to unique accents such as Indian and African English.

### 3\. Media and Entertainment

 Media has always been a powerful communication and a great way to spread your word. People often copy speech patterns observed in mainstream media and entertainment.
