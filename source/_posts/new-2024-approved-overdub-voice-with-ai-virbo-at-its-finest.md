 Once selected, you can translate captions and descriptions of videos in different languages. You can click "See Translation" when watching TikTok’s videos.

### 2\. Auto-generated video captions

 This feature allows viewers to enable closed captions for videos they're watching. And eliminate the need for creators to add captions manually. The auto-generated captions appear above the video creator's name on the For You Page. Captions will appear once you tap them.
