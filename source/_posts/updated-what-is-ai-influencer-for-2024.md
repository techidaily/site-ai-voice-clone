 If possible, avoid videos with multiple speakers or overlapping dialogue. Clear, single-speaker content facilitates more accurate and efficient translation.

1. **The video resolution must be of good quality**

 Aim for a video resolution ranging between 360x360 and 1920x1920 pixels. This ensures optimal visual clarity and compatibility with the translation process.

1. **Upload videos without subtitles initially**

 When uploading your video, refrain from including subtitles initially. It helps to create a more precise and tailored translation and ensures that the text aligns with the video content.

## Conclusion

**Translating videos in Instagram** opens up opportunities for connecting with diverse audiences globally. By embracing translation, users can expand their reach and foster inclusivity on the platform. Wondershare Virbo's AI Video Translator simplifies this process. It offers seamless translation and subtitle insertion without installing any apps.

 Virbo helps you connect with more people, breaking down language barriers and gaining better engagement. You can ensure accurate translations by following the guidelines while preparing the video. Basically, translation strengthens engagement and turns Instagram into a platform open to everyone.
