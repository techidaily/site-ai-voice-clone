The broadcast-quality app is lauded for its multiple capabilities, including a built-in broadcast studio and HD-quality streaming. In this article, we introduce Talk Shop Live as a live shopping platform and provide a brief guide on how to start your livestream on the platform.

## Part 1: What is TalkShopLive?

[TalkShopLive](https://talkshop.live/) is a social-selling network for home shopping and live streaming shows. It comes with a built-in buying experience for all kinds of shoppers. With Talk Shop Live, anyone can sell and buy products from anywhere through interactive video shows. You can think of ShopTalk Live as a combination of HSN, QVC, and social media tolled into one.

![talk shop live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/is-talkshoplive-right-for-you-live-shop-pros-tips-before-you-start-1.jpg)

 The TalkShopLive studio app for brands and creators brings an array of broadcast and management tools to mobile. The platform boasts of enabling users to promote and sell their shows before and after going live. This means that you can create a shoppable and shareable video for promoting your show even before it goes live. Technically, you do not have to worry about the aftermath since your content will remain shoppable after the live streaming event comes to an end.

 You also get to do a whole range of other cool things with Talk Shop Live. With this studio app, you can virtually collaborate with four people in a live stream, simulcast on Facebook, pin comments, and more. The platform is embeddable and shoppable anywhere, allowing you to host shows across platforms.

## Part 2: Who Can Benefit from Talkshoplive?

 The Walmart Talk Shop Live can potentially benefit a wide range of people. It offers an exceptional way of promoting products that can complement traditional shopping methods. This makes it an ideal live shopping platform for anyone with reliable internet and who is interested in quality products.

![talk shop live benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/is-talkshoplive-right-for-you-live-shop-pros-tips-before-you-start-2.jpg)

 Here are some specific groups who might find it particularly beneficial:

* **Sellers:** Display item details at the bottom of the screen, track sales while streaming, highlight key products during moments in the show, get access to viewership metrics, and interact with customers in real time.
* **Creators:** Sellers can enlist people on their team to be producers who will work behind the screens. The producer or moderator can be part of the live stream without being on the screen, manage sales, pin lie comments, highlight items, and perform other duties.
* **Customers:** Use the proprietary multi-embedded point-of-sale technology to purchase an item during a live show without interrupting the live shopping experience.

## Part 3: Should You Start Talkshoplive Live Shopping Event?

 TalkShopLive does more than just live streaming. Creators, hosts, and brands can broadcast live shows to demonstrate their products to viewers.

4. **Discover new products and brands:** Shoppers get real-time recommendations from hosts and influencers.
5. **Sense of a Community** : TalkShopLive fosters a sense of community where users connect

### Cons

 Choosing TalkShopLive as your live shopping platform keeps you on the right track. In addition to getting access to a wider audience, you also become more competitive in the market. However, it can be time-consuming and expensive to live stream all the time. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) promises a simplified future for sellers and creators. In particular, AI streamers can be used as a powerful tool for live shopping.

 AI streamers are avatars that replicate human streamers, keeping your viewers engaged. They offer a unique advantage over traditional human hosts in that they are available 24/7 and work based on your product information. They also have multi-lingua and multi-tasking capabilities that allow you to serve diverse groups of audiences.
