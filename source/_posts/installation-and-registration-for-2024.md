## Want to Clone Voices in Real-Time? Explore These GitHub Repositories

The advancements in AI technology have gone beyond our imagination. The AI can generate realistic images and read text aloud with the TTS tool. Also, real-time voice cloning technology has made a significant impact in today's world. You can transform plain text into lifelike AI-generated speech in various languages. It perfectly mimics the voice of another person and can read the text with accuracy.

Moreover, it uses neural networks and speech synthesis that can assist in complex domains. In this article, we'll explore some repositories of **real-time voice cloning GitHub**.

## Part 1: An Introduction to Real-Time Voice Cloning

Real-time voice cloning uses generative models to create real human voices. The building blocks are speech synthesis, voice embedding, and waveform generation. Also, the AI is trained to gather data on a set of human voice samples to generate authentic results. It gathers and learns how we talk - our pitch, rhythm, and voice quirks.

This voice cloning technology works on four models that enable real-time voice cloning. These models are text-to-Mel coder, speaker encoder, synthesizer, and vocoder. Real**\-time voice cloning software** has been integrated into various tools and platforms.
