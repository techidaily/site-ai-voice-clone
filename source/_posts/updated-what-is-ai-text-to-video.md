## Part 1: An Introduction to Descript Overdub: A Unique Video Script Influencing Toolkit

There are several instances where you make a mistake while recording, and returning to re-recoding is not ideal. Here, we introduce you to [**Descript Overdub**](https://www.descript.com/overdub), an excellent solution for dealing with script mistakes within videos. Traditionally, outdated technology does not offer such technical tools to automatically rectify mistakes in media content.

Overdubbing is useful as it adds richness to the original recording and removes errors. You can transform your videos with the **Descript Overdub AI** feature. **Descript Overdub** uses AI voice cloning that replaces incorrect audio without re-recording it. That overdubbed audio can blend in with any audio conditions.

You'll get the same result whether you record with a different mic or at a different place. It can fix audio mistakes in seconds that otherwise would take hours of editing. This feature saves money and verifies ownership before creating your AI voice. Users can edit, record, collaborate, and publish their work all in one place.

### Limitations

Despite how many features Descript offers, there are still some limitations to using this tool. In the following section, we have highlighted some of these:

* Descript doesn't have a mobile app for editing videos. Many users find it convenient to record and edit content on a smartphone rather than on a desktop.
* This tool can sometimes be a bit slow, especially on a MacBook. While this is common for video editing tools, it can be irritating while making videos.
* While you can find various templates within the Descript library, the options are not flexible. Users are unable to find different options to choose template themes.
* Although the transcription quality is generally great, it always needs some post-editing. Descript does not automatically update all changes of a word after fixing it in the transcript.
