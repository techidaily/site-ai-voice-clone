* **Localization:** As discussed earlier, considering cultural sensitivity means complying with laws. Thus, content should suit the cultural norms and preferences of the viewers. For this purpose, a video must adapt with visuals, references, and chosen language.
* **Subtitle and Dubbing Quality:** No matter what format you are using, the translation must maintain quality. Well-translated video contains well-timed and easy-to-read subtitles. They are properly formatted in the video, while dubbing matches the lip movements.
* **Contextual Understanding:** The first thing you should consider in a video is that it conveys a proper message. The translated video must reflect a deeper understanding of source materials. Also, ensure that the character’s expression, cultural references, and jokes are improved.
* **Technical Quality:** Quality matters a lot, whether it's video quality or translation quality. A good, translated video contains sound quality, resolution, pitch, and speed. Overall, it must preserve all the production values of the video.

## Part 2\. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

 Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers. Colorful and catchy videos grab the attention of the viewers and encourage them to buy the product. The main problem can occur if your target audience cannot understand the language that you have used in videos.

 As we all know, English is one of the most spoken languages. But not everyone speaks or understands it. People can face various problems in understanding the language. That's why video translators play a crucial role in every person's life. If there is no video translator, the world will become dull. Let's discuss some challenges that can occur if video translators do not exist.

 If your viewers understand the Spanish language, but you are creating videos in other languages. It will create a communication barrier because your audience does not understand the language in the video. Language barriers can affect communication and lead to misunderstandings. Suppose you are posting video lectures on the website to offer courses. In this case, if you don't use a video language translator, it will misinterpret the viewers.
