Users can explore this repository to clone their voice within 5 seconds. This **real-time voice cloning** **GitHub** repository is an implementation of the SV2TTS framework. SV2TTS uses a three-stage deep learning process to carry out voice cloning. This implementation creates a digital voice representation from a brief audio sample. Then, it utilizes this sample to generate diverse speech from the given text.

* Install Requirements:

To install it on your system, it's better to have a stable GPU for a smooth experience. Other than this, you should have at least Python 3.5 for the repository to function properly. Also, it is necessary to install ffmpeg files to process audio files.

### 2\. PaddleSpeech

It is an exceptional open-source toolkit on the Paddle-Paddle platform. With this simple toolkit, you can perform a variety of audio-related tasks. It employs new cutting-edge technology and production-ready streaming ASR and TTS systems. Plus, this repository provides fast-processing models to the users. PaddleSpeech also utilizes self-defined linguistics to adapt to the Chinese context.

This repository aims to inspire industrial and academic fields through its several modules. These may include Automatic Speech Recognition, Keyword Spotting, Speech Translation, etc. PaddleSpeech also combines its task with various other fields, including NLP and Computer Vision.

### 3\. Multi-Tacotron Voice Cloning

Multi-Tacotron is the ultimate in voice cloning with multilingual implementation. You can make use of this repository for Russian and English languages. This repository builds upon **real-time voice cloning online** with a four-stage learning framework. With a few seconds of audio, it crafts a numerical representation of a voice. Furthermore, it uses this audio to condition a text-to-speech model.

For cloning the English language, the original implementation is enough. You don't require a high-tier GPU to run this toolbox; even a low-tier one will work well. There are also some pre-trained models for datasets that you can download with ease.

### 4\. Coqui TTS

You can explore the finest text-to-speech toolkit with Coqui. Boasting high-performance models, it covers TTS tasks effortlessly. This repository extends its ability with speaker encoder for various Vocoder models. With swift model training and multi-speaker TTS support, it stands out for efficiency. TTS version 2 now has 16 more languages and better overall performance.

Moreover, TTS can now work smoothly with even less than 200ms latency. More than 1100 languages are supported with pre-trained models of this repository. Plus, all TTS models are ready to use with efficient model training.

### 5\. Multilingual Text-to-Speech (Tomiinek)

This repository available on GitHub is an implementation of Tacotron 2\. It supports code-switching, voice cloning, and parameter-sharing for versatile experiments. You can utilize training data and source code for optimized voice cloning. Also, it compares three models for multilingual synthesis. This repo also has samples generated by a monolingual vanilla Tacotron.

Additionally, multilingual Text-to-Speech comes with a convolutional encoder with parameters that are language-specific. There are also some interactive demos that introduce code-switching abilities and provide multilingual training on the model.

### 6\. One-Shot Voice Cloning CMsmartvoice

One-shot voice cloning with Unet-TTS features a powerful speaker and style transfer capabilities. The repository generates text sounds with provided inferencing code and pre-training models. Its model training focuses on neutral emotion to avoid strong emotional speech. Also, it addresses the challenges of out-of-domain style using the Unet network and AdaIN layer.

Users are not required to use reference speech if they plan to do one-shot voice cloning. Also, the requirement to manually enter statistics of duration is no longer essential. Only Linux users can install it with the correct TensorFlow and TensorFlow-addons versions.

### 7\. Voice-Synthesis (smoke-trees)

This approach creates a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. Then, it uses this audio for text-to-speech synthesis. SV2TTS excels with deep learning and uses a speaker encoder, synthesizer, and voice coder. It clones voices in real time with zero-shot learning. The repository identifies voices, and the synthesizer generates Mel-spectrograms from the text. Finally, the vocoder turns them into lifelike waveforms.

All you need to do is feed this repository your voice sample or custom voice, and it can synthesize a clone of it for you. You can also use a microphone to input your text commands through speech. There are also instructions given if you want to work with your own models on different datasets and language mediums.

### 8\. VoiceSmith (dunky11)

VoiceSmith is an easy-to-use repository requiring no coding experience. It fine-tunes a pipeline based on Delightful TTS and UnivNet for single or many speakers. Users can opt from a proprietary 5000 speaker dataset with automatic text normalization. Windows and Linux are supported, and an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is for faster training. Docker is essential for seamless operation for users exploring **real-time voice cloning online**.

* Install Requirements:

A RAM of less than 8GB may not work well with it, so it’s better to use at least 8GB RAM. To use this repository on Linux, you are advised to install Docker Engine. Users also get to play around with an emotional 60-speaker dataset-trained model.

### 9\. Voice Cloning App by BenAAndrew

This Python or Pytorch repository empowers users for effortless voice synthesis. You can enjoy automatic dataset creation, multi-language support, and easy remote training. It allows you to build datasets and proceed further by using a training model. The tool offers new datasets and lets you extend existing datasets for voice cloning. This simple approach elevates your experience of **real-time voice cloning on GitHub.**

In future improvements, this repository is expected to support AMD GPU for better performance. Also, it claims to improve its batch size estimation. You can run it on Windows 10 or Ubuntu 20.04 operating system with at least 5GB of required disk space.

### 10\. Unet-TTS

Unet-TTS excels in unseen speaker and style transfer for one-shot voice cloning. It works in seconds to produce target audio through voice synthesis without fine-tuning. There are various speaking styles embedded in a seamless way. Its algorithm works on a skip-connected structure to capture speaker and utterance features. Users can get precise inferences of complex voice characteristics and speaking styles.

However, it’s still a challenging task to perform out-of-domain transfer. According to the similarity evaluation, the new model excels in speaker embedding and style modeling. The new model can also discover utterance-level details from the reference audio.
