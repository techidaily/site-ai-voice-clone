## Clone Your Voice: Harness the Potential of AI

One of the prominent applications of artificial intelligence is in the field of AI voice cloning. It eliminates bad-quality audio in a snap and replaces it with natural-sounding AI voices. Where production houses used to pay millions to voice actors, they can now use voice clones. This article will discuss the rise of voice cloning, its applications, and a relevant tool.

## Part 1: A Basic Definition of AI Voice Cloning

**AI voice cloning** refers to the techniques that enable users to generate deepfake voices from a sample. If you provide a sample that fulfills data requirements, AI will generate a voice you can customize. At the core, vast training datasets make the backbone of these tools. This data enables AI to analyze samples, recognize frequencies, and generate an exact AI voice.

For the perfect voice cloning, neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) collaborate. They ensure the level of similarity and focus on elements like tone, emotion, and accents.

The next step involves the integration of Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology in these **AI voice cloning-free** tools. This means you can clone the voice of Taylor Swift and use TTS technology to make it say whatever you want.

1. **Entertainment Industry:** Voice cloning tools reduce the financial burdens of hiring professional voice actors. With advanced algorithms, they can do emotional voice expressions. AI technology is devoid of human errors and enhances voiceover productivity.
2. **Interactive Customer Support:** These tools benefit all customer care sites covering various industries. Advanced voice recognition can bring realistic expressions in AI voices. This means AI voices will interact with customers just as any other human providing interactive solutions.
3. **Gaming and Education Industry:** eBooks can become 10 times more interactive with these tools. Online learning and gaming experiences have become more interactive. Tutors and gamers can create voice clones for once and use them via TTS tech later.
4. **Multilingual Voice Dubbing:** The majority of voice cloning tools have multilingual integration. This means that documentaries, eBooks, films, and everything can be dubbed. The multilingual compatibility broadens the scope of voice-focused industries and services.
5. **Content Generation:** These AI voice cloning tools have become integral in the creative industry. Creating vlogs, tutorials, and explainer videos with voiceovers became a trend. You can use this technique to clone your voice and create voiceovers from texts.

Here are the seven best whiteboard animation videos so you can get an idea of which choice suits your business the best:

### 1.[Oxfam](https://youtube/wuDQIjGRCfg.com)

 Whiteboard animation may still be effective whether it's for entertainment, marketing, or education. But it's also capable of addressing weightier issues. This describes the situation with the Oxfam International video. Raising awareness of the predicament of women worldwide is the task they confront.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-oxfam.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-oxfam.jpg)

 The video walks you through the development of women's rights across time as well as current issues that affect them. It's a really powerful declaration of the organization's mission and a rallying cry for all of its supporters. It's impressive how much one can do in such a short period.

### 2. [Unilever Series](https://youtu.be/qw6Vuz70tZE)

 Despite the fun and enjoyable material, Unilever uses the ads to convey a serious message: there is a need for men's hair and skin care. This is a fantastic illustration of how an animated whiteboard can be utilized to boost engagement and foster customer loyalty. The short, hilarious, and emotional videos are all three. An observer observes one and desires to observe others.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-unilever.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-unilever.jpg)

 The Unilever series, one of the greatest whiteboard and sales video examples, demonstrates how to effectively utilize animation to communicate difficult ideas. By presenting the progress toward several development targets in multiple formats, including graphs, charts, and maps, this data-driven video aids the spectator in more intuitively understanding complicated data. To keep the spectator interested, the animation also incorporates minor movements like the character's hand motions and the sporadic zoom in or out.

### 3.[Where Good Ideas Come from:](https://youtu.be/NugRZGDbPFU)

 This video addresses Steven Johnson's Where Good Ideas Come From, which examines the history of invention, using the conventional hand-drawn whiteboard format. What's important to note is that the video was specifically made to explain the fundamental thesis of the book and is not in any way self-promotional. This is echoed in the last frame of the illustration, as the camera pans out to show us the whole artwork.

![whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg)

 The capacity of whiteboard videos to simplify a difficult procedure is what distinguishes them from other animated explainer videos. The way that this specific video develops is fascinating. Since they are presented as logically related to one another, the concepts flow consistently and are simple to understand. As a result, we are motivated to read more of the book, which supports the assumption that the concepts being presented are part of a system.

### 4.[Content 2020 by Coca Cola](https://youtu.be/LyDf-twhpCo)

 Perhaps the finest whiteboard animation video to ever be posted online was Content 2020 by Coca-Cola. Long animations might sometimes be the greatest option for a company.

It is the ideal illustration of the rule that the longer your video, the more devoted your audience must be.
