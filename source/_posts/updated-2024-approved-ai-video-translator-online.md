## Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the**online live shopping** success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

 A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

 Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

 One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

 As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

## Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream

 With the help[of Smartzer’s Interactive Video Platform](https://www.smartzer.com/shoppable-livestream-video) , Samsung Panama delivered highly successful live video shopping for its customers. The shoppable livestream featured exclusive, event-based discount deals for the customers. During the livestream shopping experience, sales representatives from Samsung would demonstrate various products to hundreds of viewers. At the same time, customers would communicate with the host through a chatbot using their nicknames.

![samsung live shop](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-2.jpg)

**Achievement:** The Samsung livestream shopping created a personalized and bespoke shopping experience, replicating the benefits of in-person shopping. Product demonstrations by sales reps and exclusive deals captivated hundreds of viewers. In addition, the interactive chat that was fueled by personalized nicknames fostered an engaging and lovely atmosphere. This led to a significant boost in sales and customer satisfaction.

**Lessons drawn** : Livestream shopping combined with interactive features and exclusive deals unlocks a powerful sales channel. With personalized engagement, brands can gain from fostering real-time connections with viewers. It also allows them to create an engaging and informative experience while fostering compelling value propositions.

## Part 3: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 2: Giosg One-on-One Live Shop

 In one of the game-changing strategies,[giosg](https://www.giosg.com/en/live-video-shopping) launched an online live shopping feature that allows sellers to have one-to-one voice and video calls with customers. With this feature, sellers can handhold their customers throughout the entire shopping process. The live online shopping feature works in the same way sales executives approach customers in traditional settings.

![giosg live shop](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-3.jpg)

**Achievement:** The live online shopping feature by giosg offers a unique and seamless shopping experience for other sellers and customers.

By integrating video calls into an e-commerce platform, the brand created a seamless and engaging experience for the shoppers, blurring the lines between online and offline shopping.

## Part 4: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 3: Nordstrom In-person and Live Shopping Blend

 The American luxury department store chain Nordstrom launched a[live online shop](https://nordstromrsvp.com/nlive) intending to blend its digital and in-person capabilities. The live stream shop allows customers to shop under the expertise of the chain’s store. Shoppers also have access to informative events by experts in fashion, beauty, and home.

![Nordstrom live shop](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-4.jpg)

**Achievement:** The live stream shop significantly impacted Nordstrom’s performance in the market.
