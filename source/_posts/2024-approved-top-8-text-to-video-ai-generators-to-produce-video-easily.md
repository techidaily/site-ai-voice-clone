The AI then processes this input and generates a corresponding headshot that matches the desired criteria.

These generators can be used for various purposes, including creating profile pictures, avatars, character images for games or storytelling, and even for artistic or creative projects. It's worth noting that while these generators can produce impressive results, they might sometimes unintentionally perpetuate certain biases present in the training data, which is an important consideration when using such tools.

## Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold.

On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

 As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:
