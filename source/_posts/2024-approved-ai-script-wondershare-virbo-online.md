Some voice generators also enable you to modify the pronunciation and allow you to adjust your generated sound according to your particular requirements.

### **4\. Intonation and Emphasis**

 Spoken language needs to use emphasis and intonation to express the emotions, meaning, and context of a statement.

Both factors help the narrator's voice generator effectively deliver the information. The narrator's voice generator must be able to modify intonation and emphasis to provide natural speech.
