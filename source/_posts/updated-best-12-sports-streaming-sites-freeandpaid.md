## Author’s Verdict

 Sora by OpenAI is arguably the most advanced text-to-video generator AI to date. While it can generate ultra-realistic videos, it remains inaccessible to the public for the time being. For those seeking immediate solutions in the absence of access to Sora, several other text-to-video AI platforms offer compelling features and functionalities.

 Among these, you might want to check out Steve AI for its innovative approach to transforming text into engaging videos. It provides collaboration tools and offers diverse animation styles for you to choose from. But if you want a text-to-video AI that is free to use, you can try Stable-diffusion-videos and experiment with your prompts.

## Bonus: The Best Video-to-Text Tool – Wondershare Virbo

 While**text-to-video generators** allow you to create videos from text, sometimes you might want to do the reverse: extract text from videos. This is where Wondershare Virbo comes into play.

 Virbo is widely regarded as one of the best video-to-text tools available. With its advanced algorithms and intuitive interface, it makes the process of transcribing videos easy through its[Video Translator](https://virbo.wondershare.com/video-translation.html) tool.
