## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

![Set a timer to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-8.jpg)

 A whiteboard animation video breaks down difficult concepts or themes step-by-step.

But how can you choose the finest choice when there are so many possibilities accessible today? Here are the seven best whiteboard animation videos so you can get an idea of which choice suits your business the best:

### 1.[Oxfam](https://youtube/wuDQIjGRCfg.com)

 Whiteboard animation may still be effective whether it's for entertainment, marketing, or education. But it's also capable of addressing weightier issues. This describes the situation with the Oxfam International video. Raising awareness of the predicament of women worldwide is the task they confront.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-oxfam.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-oxfam.jpg)

 The video walks you through the development of women's rights across time as well as current issues that affect them. It's a really powerful declaration of the organization's mission and a rallying cry for all of its supporters. It's impressive how much one can do in such a short period.

### 2. [Unilever Series](https://youtu.be/qw6Vuz70tZE)

 Despite the fun and enjoyable material, Unilever uses the ads to convey a serious message: there is a need for men's hair and skin care. This is a fantastic illustration of how an animated whiteboard can be utilized to boost engagement and foster customer loyalty. The short, hilarious, and emotional videos are all three. An observer observes one and desires to observe others.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-unilever.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-unilever.jpg)

 The Unilever series, one of the greatest whiteboard and sales video examples, demonstrates how to effectively utilize animation to communicate difficult ideas. By presenting the progress toward several development targets in multiple formats, including graphs, charts, and maps, this data-driven video aids the spectator in more intuitively understanding complicated data. To keep the spectator interested, the animation also incorporates minor movements like the character's hand motions and the sporadic zoom in or out.

### 3.[Where Good Ideas Come from:](https://youtu.be/NugRZGDbPFU)

 This video addresses Steven Johnson's Where Good Ideas Come From, which examines the history of invention, using the conventional hand-drawn whiteboard format. What's important to note is that the video was specifically made to explain the fundamental thesis of the book and is not in any way self-promotional. This is echoed in the last frame of the illustration, as the camera pans out to show us the whole artwork.

![whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/whiteboard-explainer-where-good-ideas-come-from.jpg)

 The capacity of whiteboard videos to simplify a difficult procedure is what distinguishes them from other animated explainer videos. The way that this specific video develops is fascinating. Since they are presented as logically related to one another, the concepts flow consistently and are simple to understand. As a result, we are motivated to read more of the book, which supports the assumption that the concepts being presented are part of a system.

### 4.[Content 2020 by Coca Cola](https://youtu.be/LyDf-twhpCo)

 Perhaps the finest whiteboard animation video to ever be posted online was Content 2020 by Coca-Cola. Long animations might sometimes be the greatest option for a company. This video is lengthier than the typical 2-minute explainer video since it discusses a new marketing plan that the firm has adopted. It is the ideal illustration of the rule that the longer your video, the more devoted your audience must be.

![best-whiteboard-explainer-video-coca-cola.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/best-whiteboard-explainer-video-coca-cola.jpg)

 whether you're not sure whether they can sit through a 10-minute video, break it up into smaller chunks. Similar to this video, it opens by pointing out how marketing and advertising are changing and how conventional approaches are no longer successful in reaching and attracting people.

## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.
