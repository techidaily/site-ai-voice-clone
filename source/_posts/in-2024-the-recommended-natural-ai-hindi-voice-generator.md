## What Is an AI Video Maker? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1.**What is an AI video maker?**

AI video maker refers to a video creation tool that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automate or enhance various aspects of the video production process. These tools often integrate machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to perform tasks such as video editing, scene recognition, automated video generation, voiceover synthesis, and more.

With AI video makers, users can create professional-looking videos more efficiently and with less manual effort. These tools can analyze raw video footage, apply filters, add visual effects, generate subtitles, and even suggest relevant music or soundtracks based on the video's content. Some AI video makers can also create videos from scratch using provided assets, such as images and text, transforming them into dynamic and engaging visual presentations.

The use of AI in video creation has significantly simplified the process and made it accessible to individuals and businesses without specialized video editing skills. As AI technology advances, AI video makers will likely become even more sophisticated, allowing for more creative and innovative video productions.

## Part 2\. Any differences between an AI video maker and a generator?

Yes, there is a difference between an AI video maker and an AI video generator, although they are related concepts.

### 1\. AI Video Maker

An AI video maker is a software tool or platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to assist in video creation and editing. It provides users various automated features and tools to streamline video production. AI video makers typically offer functionalities such as automatic video editing, scene recognition, visual effects, subtitle generation, voiceover synthesis, and music suggestions. These tools are designed to make video creation more accessible and efficient for users, regardless of their level of expertise in video editing.

### 2\. AI Video Generator

### 2\. Discuss hot topics your audience wants to talk about

![Hot Topic](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-3.jpg)

 If you are a new creator who is looking to make his mark as a successful streamer, then you should capitalize on what already seems to be working. Most creators make this fatal mistake when they try to invent something new, earlier in their streaming career.

 However, you need to have a loyal audience in order to do so. People use YouTube to get information or some sort of entertainment. Whether you are a new creator or someone who already has a set audience, your main focus should be to discuss hot topics or play trending games to get views faster and efficiently.

 To make it easier for you, let’s say that a new game rolls out. By discussing the game or playing the game on live stream, you are going to attract the right audience according to your YouTube channel and gain followers instead of being clueless.

### 3\. Ranking live videos

![Ranking Live Videos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-4.jpg)

 Yes! It is possible to rank videos on the go as you go live. By doing YouTube research, you can leverage different keywords and rank for them as you go online. Most people make evergreen videos and put pre-recorded ones but compared to them, the live world is still small.

 That is exactly your ticket to success. First, you need to understand the problems that your audience has. How can you solve them? What concerns do they have on a particular topic? Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.

 It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.

### 4\. Building a community

![Building a community](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-5.jpg)

 With other tips on the list, you must be vary of how important your audience is especially when it comes to YouTube Live. The third secret and one of the most important**YouTube streaming guidelines** is building a community.

 Once you do that, you also need to talk to them as they come live. Build deep connections with your viewers and you will see a huge increase in your subscribers and overall viewer count.

### 5\. Promote your broadcast

![Promote your broadcast](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-6.jpg)

 We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.

 First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.

 But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.

### 6\. Collaboration

![Collaboration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-7.jpg)

 Once you grow a little bit, you can collaborate with other streamers to join two audiences together. If you look closely, we have multiple streamers connecting with each other and having fun together. For example, Fouseytube sometimes connects with Sneako and both of them then go to N3on to make the biggest live stream in the history of social media.

 When you collaborate with someone and entertain the audience in a way that they want to be, You need to not only build a community of people but also collaborate with other streamers which will open new aspects of your streaming journey.

## Part 2: Common Problems & Solutions of YouTube Live

 But if you want a complete AI Live Streamer guide, then you should check out[Virbo Live Stream User Guide](https://virbo.wondershare.com/guide-live.html) as it moves you through every step and provides a complete guideline of steps to follow to have the perfect stream up and running.

### 1\. Stream not starting

![Stream not starting](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-8.jpg)

 One of the most common problems with YouTube Live is streams not starting. Imagine you have an audience of people waiting but the stream just does not start. It can be unresponsive, which is a common issue with YouTube Live.

 Here’s what you can do to fix the issue. Firstly, you need to verify your account and wait for 24 hours for this issue to be fixed. It is because new channels need this type of verification to allow you to start streaming.

 However, if that still doesn’t fix the issue, you should try restarting your streaming service and computer. After a good reset, you can start streaming again and it should get you up and running.

### 2\. Poor video and audio quality

![Poor video and audio quality](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-9.jpg)

 We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

 Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

### 3\. Laggy stream

![Laggy stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-10.jpg)

 Similar to poor video and audio, a laggy stream can occur due to a bad internet connection. Most streamers have a plethora of applications opened in the background that all take some level of internet.

 Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.

### 4\. Lack of interaction on stream

![Lack of interaction on stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-11.jpg)

 A lot of people suffer from a lack of interaction even if they have slowly started to build a respectable viewer count. So, what should you do in that situation? Actively engage with viewers by responding to comments, asking questions, and running polls/contests.

 Encourage viewers to interact with each other. Invite guests or co-hosts to add diverse perspectives. You should always be trying something new that would excite the viewers into taking part.
