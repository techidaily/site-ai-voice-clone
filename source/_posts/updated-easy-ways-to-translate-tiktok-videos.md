## **Part 1\. Why do you need AI voice changers?**

 First, let’s start by listing some reasons why you need an AI voice changer app. As mentioned, there are many reasons to use an AI-powered voice changer as this program can unlock endless possibilities.

Below are some of the uses:

* **Privacy and security:** Assume you’re a journalist who wants to record audio about important information, but you don’t want to disclose your subject’s voice. Or, you can be a video gamer looking for the perfect AI voice that matches your video game personality.
* **Entertainment and fun:** Are your friends often pranking you with videos and audio recordings? You can score one against them by recording a prank audio or video using an AI voice changer tool.
* **Content creator:** Are you a content creator on YouTube, TikTok, Reels, and other platforms? You can use AI voice to create high-quality content with fun and engaging narrations. AI voices can also help create top-quality podcasts.
* **Accessibility:** Not everyone is blessed with a celebrity voice. It’s even more challenging to create content for those with voice challenges. But with AI voice transformers, you can convert text to audio before adding your preferred voice effect.

## **Part 2\.** **Explore realistic AI voice generator**

 The AI voice generators listed above are undoubtedly helpful in what they do. However, consider[Wondershare Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/) to enjoy more features when transforming your voice.
