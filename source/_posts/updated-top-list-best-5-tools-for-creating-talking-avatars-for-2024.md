## What Is an AI Artist?

## **Part 1\. What is an AI artist?**

AI artist refers to an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to create art autonomously or assist human artists in their creative process. AI artists use machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to analyze and understand patterns in existing artworks and generate new art based on that knowledge.

Some AI artists can create paintings, drawings, or digital art, while others can generate music, poetry, or video content. They work by learning from a vast dataset of existing artworks or creative content and then producing original pieces that mimic the style, themes, or elements present in those examples.

AI artists are not meant to replace human creativity but rather to augment it and inspire new ideas. They can be valuable tools for artists to experiment with different styles, generate concepts, or overcome creative blocks. AI art is continually evolving, and the creations of AI artists often spark discussions about the intersection of technology and creativity in the art world.

## **Part 2\. Guidelines for responsible use of AI artists**

When utilizing AI artists, it is essential to consider the following factors:

#### 1\. Data and Copyright

Ensure that the AI artist's training data and the generated content do not violate copyright or intellectual property rights. Make sure to use properly licensed datasets and obtain permission when using copyrighted materials as inputs.

#### 2\. Bias and Fairness

AI artists learn from existing data, and if the data contains biases, it may reflect in the generated content. Be cautious of any biases present in the training data and take steps to mitigate or address them to ensure fairness and inclusivity in the generated art.

#### 3\. Creative Input

While AI artists can be helpful tools, it's essential to maintain the artist's creative input and not rely solely on AI-generated content. AI should be seen as a collaborator or a source of inspiration rather than a substitute for human creativity.

#### 4\. Experimentation and Exploration

Use AI artists to explore new artistic styles, techniques, and ideas. Embrace the experimental nature of AI-generated art and push the boundaries of creativity with technology.

#### 5\. Ethical Use

Be mindful of the content generated by AI artists and ensure that it aligns with ethical standards and societal norms. Avoid using AI to create harmful or offensive content.

#### 6\. Authenticity and Attribution

If AI-generated art is used in public or commercial contexts, clearly attribute the contribution of the AI artist and respect the transparency in disclosing the involvement of AI in the creative process.

#### 7\. Technical Limitations

Understand the limitations of the AI artist's capabilities and know that it may not always produce perfect or refined results. It's important to consider the context and appropriateness of the generated content.

#### 8\. User Privacy

If the AI artist interacts with users or requires user data, ensure user privacy is protected and data handling complies with relevant regulations and best practices.

#### 9\. Continual Improvement

Keep track of advancements in AI art and regularly update the AI artist's models to benefit from the latest technological developments and improvements.

 If you are a new creator who is looking to make his mark as a successful streamer, then you should capitalize on what already seems to be working. Most creators make this fatal mistake when they try to invent something new, earlier in their streaming career.

 However, you need to have a loyal audience in order to do so. People use YouTube to get information or some sort of entertainment. Whether you are a new creator or someone who already has a set audience, your main focus should be to discuss hot topics or play trending games to get views faster and efficiently.

 That is exactly your ticket to success. First, you need to understand the problems that your audience has. How can you solve them? What concerns do they have on a particular topic? Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.

 It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.

### 4\. Building a community

![Promote your broadcast](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-6.jpg)

 We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.

 First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.

 But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.

### 6\. Collaboration

![Collaboration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-7.jpg)

 Once you grow a little bit, you can collaborate with other streamers to join two audiences together. If you look closely, we have multiple streamers connecting with each other and having fun together. For example, Fouseytube sometimes connects with Sneako and both of them then go to N3on to make the biggest live stream in the history of social media.

 When you collaborate with someone and entertain the audience in a way that they want to be, You need to not only build a community of people but also collaborate with other streamers which will open new aspects of your streaming journey.

### 2\. Poor video and audio quality

![Poor video and audio quality](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-9.jpg)

 We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

 Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

### 3\. Laggy stream

![Laggy stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-10.jpg)

 Similar to poor video and audio, a laggy stream can occur due to a bad internet connection. Most streamers have a plethora of applications opened in the background that all take some level of internet.

 Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.

### 4\. Lack of interaction on stream

![Lack of interaction on stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-11.jpg)

 A lot of people suffer from a lack of interaction even if they have slowly started to build a respectable viewer count. So, what should you do in that situation? Actively engage with viewers by responding to comments, asking questions, and running polls/contests.

 Encourage viewers to interact with each other. Invite guests or co-hosts to add diverse perspectives. You should always be trying something new that would excite the viewers into taking part.
