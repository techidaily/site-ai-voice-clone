![upload a photo on talking photo virbo](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/guide/windows/talking-photo-feature-1.jpg)

Step 3 **Add an audio animation to the photo**

Enter the **Text Script** you want to convert into audio. Alternatively, click the **Audio Script** button to upload a WAV or MP3 file or extract audio from the video. You can even live to record your own voice. The maximum audio duration is 2 minutes.

![enter the text script or audio on virbo talking photo](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/talking-photo-3.jpg)

Step 4 **Customize the audio settings (Optional)**

If you're using the Text Script option, you may need to customize audio settings like language, volume, speed, and pitch. Skip this step if you've already recorded an audio file.
