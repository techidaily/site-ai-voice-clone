## 10 Best Text-to-Video AI Generators to Create Engaging Videos

 Text-to-video AI generators have many potential benefits. With such tools, you can produce multiple videos of high quality while saving time. This can also benefit content creators by generating engaging videos by adding a script. Moreover, education trainers can transform their lectures and notes into compelling videos. This can help students to absorb information through captivating visuals.

 If you are interested in**AI text-to-video** tools, this article is for you. In this guide, you can find brief descriptions of AI text to video generators. We will also mention their significant features, which can help create videos.

## Part 1: How Text-to-Video AI Generators Work to Create Videos

 Text-to-video AI generators produce videos in an instant way. The first step involves the entering of input data. This data acts as a set of instructions, descriptions, characters, keywords, and other required details.

 Afterward, semantic understanding is conducted through NLP and NER models. Such models extract information from the input text, such as characters, locations, dialogues, etc. This step is significant as it helps produce a relevant visual video for the user.

 Once done, the AI tool starts planning the video scenes through the extracted information. While creating the structure of the video, the tool selects relevant objects, backgrounds, transitions, graphics, and overlays. Afterward, the AI tool adds visual elements and effects to make a creative video. If the video is animated, the tool adds a sense of motion to the objects, backgrounds, and characters.

 Moreover, human emotion is also added according to the script's demand. If there are dialogues between the characters, the AI tool will use its TTS engine to produce voiceovers. During this process, relevant background music and sound effects are added to ensure the captivity of the video. Once the visual and audio data is generated, the tool merges each scene smartly.

## Part 2\. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

 Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers.
