## Part 4\. Troubleshooting Issues When Converting Video Voice to Text

 Creating clear and accurate transcripts is essential for professional settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls that can impact transcription quality:

Issue 1: Background Noise

**Solution:** Noisy recordings can cause problems with transcription accuracy. Luckily, many video editing programs have noise-reduction features. Running your audio through one of these before conversion can make a big difference.

Issue 2: Accents or Dialects

**Solution:** Most speech recognition software is good these days, but accents and dialects can still trip them up. Check your software’s settings for options to adjust the recognition model. Some programs even let you upload a sample of the speaker’s voice to improve accuracy.

Issue 3: Punctuation Errors

**Solution:** Some software offers built-in punctuation correction you can use. If unavailable, find a separate grammar tool after conversion. Always proofread the transcript yourself for any missing punctuation.

Issue 4: Overlapping Voices of Speakers

**Solution:** If the video has multiple speakers, try software that can differentiate voices. This includes interviews and panel discussions. You can always transcribe each speaker’s section if that's not an option. Then, add timestamps to identify speaker changes in the transcript.

![online meeting concept](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/convert-video-voice-to-text-17.jpg)

Issue 5: Inconsistent Transcription Format

**Solution:** Most video-to-text software allows you to format after the converter generates the transcript. You can adjust fonts, add paragraph breaks, and even format speaker identification within the program. Also, you can always export the transcript to a word processor for in-depth formatting.

## Part 1: What is AI Text to Speech?

AI text to speech (TTS) is the cutting-edge technology that utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to convert written text into natural-sounding spoken language. By analyzing the textual input, AI TTS systems generate audio output that simulates human speech, incorporating elements such as intonation, rhythm, and emphasis. This advanced technology enables computers and devices to communicate with users using lifelike and expressive voices.

AI voice text to speech has numerous applications across various domains:

**Accessibility:** AI text to voice technology empowers individuals with visual impairments or reading difficulties to access written content by converting it into spoken language. It enhances accessibility by enabling users to listen to digital books, articles, and other textual materials.

**Language Learning:** AI TTS tools aid language learners in improving pronunciation and comprehension. Learners can listen to correct pronunciation models and practice speaking skills by converting written text into spoken language.

**Assistive Technologies:** Text to voice finds applications in assistive technologies such as screen readers, voice assistants, and navigation systems. These technologies assist users in interacting with devices, accessing information, and navigating digital interfaces using spoken language.

**Content Creation:** AI TTS is employed in content creation for generating voiceovers in videos, podcasts, audiobooks, and other multimedia content. It enables the automation of voice narration, saving time and resources compared to traditional voice recording methods.
