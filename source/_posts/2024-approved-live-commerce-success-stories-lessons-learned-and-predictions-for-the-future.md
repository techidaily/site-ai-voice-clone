S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

## Best Tool to Translate YouTube Video to Arabic

 Arabic is the sixth most spoken (and understood) language in the world. According to Wikipedia, there are approximately 422 million Arabic speakers (native & non-native). If you are a content creator, translating English videos to Arabic presents an opportunity to reach such a wide audience. In this article, we will present one such tool that can help you **translate video to Arabic** with ease. We will also discuss common challenges in translating videos to Arabic and how our recommendation overcomes them. So, without further ado, let’s dive in.

## Part 1\. Common Challenges In Translating English Videos Into Arabic

 Below are some common challenges you face when you want to translate videos to Arabic.

#### Lack of Semantic Nuances

 Arabic is a very rich language with semantic nuances. As it exhibits a distinct linguistic structure, taking care of linguistic and cultural nuances is the main challenge in accurately capturing the meaning during translation.

#### Translating Idiomatic Expressions

 Translating Arabic idioms, colloquialisms, and culturally specific expressions is difficult as these may not have direct or indirect equivalents in (say, for example) English. AI tools, in particular fail to accurately translate such sentences.

#### Considering Sentence Structure Variations

 Maintaining coherence and natural flow is essential for effective communication. Arabic follows a very different sentence structure, complicating the translation process. For example, it is written from right to left, therefore, the translation will be read in the opposite direction.

#### Translating Gender and Formality

 Arabic includes gender-specific pronouns and formal/informal distinctions, whereas English is more neutral towards gender. Ensuring appropriate gender and formality in translations is crucial for cultural sensitivity.

#### Lack of Technical Vocabulary

 Technical terms may lack direct equivalents in Arabic. For example, the term “Artificial Intelligence” has no equivalent translation in Arabic. Not all AI tools will translate these terms to accurately convey the meaning. Therefore, we recommend only the best.
