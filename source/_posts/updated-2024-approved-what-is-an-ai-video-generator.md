 **FAQ 3: Any way to permanently enable auto translate for YouTube on every video?**

 Sign in to YouTube and then, in any YouTube video, click the gear icon at the bottom right corner of the video, click Subtitles/CC, and click Settings. You will be taken to your Playback and Performance settings, where you should tick “Include auto-generated subtitles”.
