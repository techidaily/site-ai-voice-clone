## Part 1\. Overviewing WooCommerce E-Commerce and Its Utility in the Market

[WooCommerce](https://woo.com/) is a powerful e-commerce platform renowned for its adaptability. Its scalable nature allows you to start businesses of all sizes.

By doing so, it allows sellers to meet their branding requirements. Also, you can manage inventory, order processing, payment gateways, and shipping details. Moreover, it provides a built-in geo-location support to detect customer's address.

### Features of WooCommerce
