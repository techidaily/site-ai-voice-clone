![article-product-download](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/images2023/article-product-download.png)

When it comes to evaluating the quality of a translated video, even if it’s other than Chinese, you need to keep one factor in mind. **Accuracy** is everything in translation. Thankfully, Virbo is known for its reliable and accurate translation results in all the languages it supports. An accurate translation ensures the message is true to the source text’s meaning and intent.

However, for complex language translations, even the greatest AI would suffer. This is because of complex grammar, idiomatic expressions, and specialized terminology. In those cases, you might need to edit some parts of the translation manually. Overall, accuracy is the landmark of quality in translated Chinese videos.
