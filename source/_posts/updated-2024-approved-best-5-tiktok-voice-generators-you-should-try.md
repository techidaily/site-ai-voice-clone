Isolated communities often develop distinct accents due to limited interactions. More commonly, English-speaking populations have migrated and settled in various regions, blending the local language and native English accents. Due to this mixing, new and unique accents emerge.

### 2\. Colonization and Imperialism

 The British Empire's expansion era resulted in several colonial settlements. As a result, English was spread to numerous territories and far-off places in the world. The amalgamation of English with local languages and dialects gave rise to unique accents such as Indian and African English.

 Media has always been a powerful communication and a great way to spread your word. People often copy speech patterns observed in mainstream media and entertainment. These include movies, TV shows, and music. This can lead to the development of certain distinct accents and dialects. This particularly occurs in regions that have high media exposure.

### 4\. Education and Socioeconomic Factors

 Certain accents have been associated with distinct socioeconomic factors. Higher levels of education are often associated with more standardized and prestigious accents. Other influences such as occupation, social identity, and community also play a key role in determining the varying accents of individuals.

### 5\. Linguistic Drifts and Age

 Linguistic drift is a natural process that helps languages evolve. Like most languages, English has also undergone linguistic drift.

Its model training focuses on neutral emotion to avoid strong emotional speech. Also, it addresses the challenges of out-of-domain style using the Unet network and AdaIN layer.

Users are not required to use reference speech if they plan to do one-shot voice cloning. Also, the requirement to manually enter statistics of duration is no longer essential. Only Linux users can install it with the correct TensorFlow and TensorFlow-addons versions.

### 7\. [Voice-Synthesis (smoke-trees)](https://github.com/smoke-trees/Voice-synthesis)

This approach creates a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. Then, it uses this audio for text-to-speech synthesis. SV2TTS excels with deep learning and uses a speaker encoder, synthesizer, and voice coder. It clones voices in real time with zero-shot learning. The repository identifies voices, and the synthesizer generates Mel-spectrograms from the text. Finally, the vocoder turns them into lifelike waveforms.

All you need to do is feed this repository your voice sample or custom voice, and it can synthesize a clone of it for you. You can also use a microphone to input your text commands through speech. There are also instructions given if you want to work with your own models on different datasets and language mediums.
