That’s kind of what latency is like in**real-time video translation** . There’s a short delay between what’s spoken and the translated text appearing. For critical conversations, consider using pre-recorded videos with translated subtitles or voiceovers.

Supported Languages

 Apps that translate videos in real-time are getting better at handling a wider range of languages, but some are more supported than others. Check the app you’re considering and the languages it supports. If your language isn’t on the list, you might need to look for alternative solutions.
