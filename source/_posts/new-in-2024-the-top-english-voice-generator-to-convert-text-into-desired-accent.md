 If you want to dive into the world of**English accent voice generators** , you have landed on the right article. Finding a tool that captures all the details of regional accents might be overwhelming. Keep reading to discover the leading platforms to help you in this regard.

## Part 1: How Many English Accents are Available All Over The World

 English has become one of the most commonly recognized languages around the world. Many countries across the globe speak English as a first or second language. The diversity of English language accents lies specifically in this fact. This is also proof of the language’s adaptability and rich cultural history.

 Assigning an exact number to the English accents spoken globally is challenging. Accents vary greatly with regions. Sometimes even the same city can produce multiple accents of the same language. Yet, linguists suggest that an estimated 160 accents exist in the English language worldwide. While it is difficult to touch all the different accents in one sitting, here are some commonly spoken ones:

1. Received Pronunciation
2. Yorkshire
3. Scottish
4. Welsh
5. Cockney
6. Irish
7. Southern American
8. Australian
9. Canadian
10. South African

## Part 2: What Are The Reasons Behind Different English Accents

 Several factors contribute to the incredible diversity found in the English language. A range of features can influence accents, some of which include the following:

### 1\. Migration, Travel, and Settlements

 Throughout history, the world has seen many languages spread across the world. Travel has always been one of the primary reasons. Isolated communities often develop distinct accents due to limited interactions. More commonly, English-speaking populations have migrated and settled in various regions, blending the local language and native English accents. Due to this mixing, new and unique accents emerge.

### 2\. Colonization and Imperialism

 The British Empire's expansion era resulted in several colonial settlements. As a result, English was spread to numerous territories and far-off places in the world. The amalgamation of English with local languages and dialects gave rise to unique accents such as Indian and African English.

### 3\. Media and Entertainment

 Media has always been a powerful communication and a great way to spread your word. People often copy speech patterns observed in mainstream media and entertainment. These include movies, TV shows, and music. This can lead to the development of certain distinct accents and dialects. This particularly occurs in regions that have high media exposure.

### 4\. Education and Socioeconomic Factors

 Certain accents have been associated with distinct socioeconomic factors. Higher levels of education are often associated with more standardized and prestigious accents. Other influences such as occupation, social identity, and community also play a key role in determining the varying accents of individuals.

### 5\. Linguistic Drifts and Age

 Linguistic drift is a natural process that helps languages evolve. Like most languages, English has also undergone linguistic drift. This phenomenon has caused notable changes in various language features. These changes can be of phonological and grammatical nature. As a result, several variations have occurred in accents and dialects.

 We previously mentioned[Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/app/video-translate) for burning subtitles on your Video. But you can also use it to translate a video, edit subtitles, create instant dubs/voiceovers, make AI avatar videos and do so much more. It is a great option if you want a host of features to streamline your content creation process besides mere subtitle translation. Virbo is available on all major platforms, such as Online Browsers, PC/Laptop, Android, and iOS devices.

### 2\. Microsoft Translator

![Microsoft Translator](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/google-translate-a-video-05.jpg)

[Microsoft Translator](https://translator.microsoft.com/) is another great option for video translation. It allows real time translated conversations across multiple devices and platforms. Another difference between Google and Microsoft Translator is that Microsoft’s Translator supports fewer languages. It’s only available for 103 languages, which is still more than big name translation services. A unique feature of Microsoft Translator is that it is also compatible with the MS Office suite. So you can use it with MS Excel, One Note, PowerPoint and Outlook. Lastly, this tool is particularly helpful with contextual understanding of a sentence.

### 3\. SubtitleBee

![SubtitleBee Mainpage](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/google-translate-a-video-06.jpg)

[SubtitleBee](https://subtitlebee.com/) is also a great service to quickly translate and add subtitles to online videos. With a reported accuracy rate of 95%, this service is among some of the most accurate in the market. Moreover, it allows you to customize subtitles, edit and add cool font styles, colors, background details and orientation to create your unique projects. Another great feature is that with SubtitleBee you can add subtitles anywhere on screen. Even on top, if you so want. It also has a supertitles feature as a bonus, which enables you to add head titles on videos.

## Part 4: FAQs about Google Translate Video Audio

**1\. Can I translate a full video with Google Translate?**

 Of course, you can use Google Translate to get the translation of any length video. You will first have to transcribe the entire audio and then translate that transcript with the help of Google Video. You can use services like Virbo to add these translated subtitles to the original video.

**2\. Does Google Translate really work for video translation?**

 Well, Google Translate does not directly translate a video. You have to integrate it with other services like YouTube to get translation and then use Google Translate as a secondary tool to translate a video.

**3\. Can I get a translated video in my native language?**

 Yes, Google Translate supports almost 133 languages of the world. If your native language is spoken by a large population, chances are Google supports its translation to and from other languages. So, you can get a translated video in your native language.

**4\. What languages does Google Translate support?**

 Google Translate supports approximately 133 languages of the world at the moment. But it keeps on adding new language support every once in a while. You can get translations in all popular languages like English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, Hindi, Italian, Russian, Korean, etc.

## Conclusion

 That’s pretty much all about translating a video using Google Translate. Tools like Google Translate and Wondershare Virbo make our world more connected than ever. They bridge boundaries and bring people together. But, don’t forget, if you are translating any copyrighted content with Google Translate, you may need permission.
