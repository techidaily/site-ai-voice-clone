They are better than such extensions due to the customization options in translation.

 Take the example of[**Wondershare Virbo**](https://virbo.wondershare.com/) , which offers AI translation in human-like voices. Unlike Chrome Extensions, you can define your translating parameters. It can turn your video into targeted language and select voice, tones, and accents. Apart from translation, it also provides AI avatars, video templates, and much more. That’s why this AI tool is worth trying if compared with Chrome Extensions.
