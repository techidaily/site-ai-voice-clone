Veed has many one-click features. For instance, auto subtitles, translations, social media formatting, templates, video compression, etc are all available in one simple click.

**6\. Can Veed translate subtitles?**

Yes, Veed also supports translating subtitles. Simply upload your subtitle file in SRT format and leave the rest to Veed. **Veed io subtitle translation**is just as accurate as its video translation feature.

**7\. Is Veed good for editing?**

Veed has many exceptional features that make content creation easy. But, it cannot replace a full-fledged video editor or help you create a new video from scratch. This is its biggest disadvantage. If you want to create a video, you can try to use Wondershare Virbo.

## Conclusion

All said, Veed is a fantastic tool that makes translation into multiple languages as easy as possible. You can use the **Veed translate** feature to translate your video content into 125+ languages of the world, making it accessible to a larger audience. Videos in local languages get more engagement than those without because people can closely relate with the content. By adding captions in other languages, you can engage audiences from those countries, Veed supports an extensive range of content creators with their creative projects. What should you do if you want to create a video from scratch or want to try another alternative to translate video? Just try Wondershare Virbo!
