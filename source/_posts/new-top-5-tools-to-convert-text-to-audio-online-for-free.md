Today's digital age allows you to do much with static photos taken with your smartphone or digital camera. For instance, you can breathe some life into your smartphone snaps by creating a **talking photo free** and sharing it on your social media apps. While this might sound impossible, numerous AI-powered apps can help you generate a **talking photo online**. So, in this post, we want to introduce you to our carefully curated list of programs to create animated talking images. Read on to discover!

### Tool 1: [Wondershare Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/talking-photo.html)

![virbo talking photo tool](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/talking-photo-12.jpg)

Wondershare Virbo **talking photo AI** boasts an immersive user interface to create a **talking picture** from your local images. Alternatively, you can choose a royalty-free image template and customize it with your favorite sound animates. Virbo lets you customize the audio speed, pitch, and volume to make your talking image stand out.
