#### What Can I Do With ChatGPT?

Users can interact with ChatGPT by asking a wide array of questions and sharing prompts. It's not just about straightforward queries; ChatGPT is designed to engage in creative, informative, and entertaining discussions.

2. **Generating Inaccuracies:** It can sometimes provide incorrect or nonsensical answers that sound plausible.
3. **Sensitive Content:** ChatGPT's responses might inadvertently contain biased or offensive content despite efforts to prevent it.
