 In AI streaming, algorithms study people’s viewing history, behaviors, and preferences to provide tailormade and enjoyable experiences. The technology is also being used to promote relevant shows and movies that keep users on their platforms instead of moving to another one.

### **02 How artificial intelligence enhances the streaming experience**

 The use of artificial intelligence streams helps platforms stand out by providing relevant content. Platforms can use artificial intelligence to manage most of the processes in video streaming. This includes selection, content recommendation, and montage. As more uses of artificial intelligence streaming emerge, here are some notable impacts:

1. **AI-Powered Localization:** Platforms adapt their language and cultural approaches to enter foreign markets. With AI, the process of capturing, translating, and uploading subtitles is automated. Platforms like IMDB also use AI to source content titles, descriptions, and technical details.
2. **Audience Engagement:** With the help of machine language, platforms can accurately keep their audience engaged. AI helps to translate social media posts, catalog information, canned chat responses, knowledgebases, FAQs, website pages, and manuals.
3. **Content Protection:** With AI stream, platforms can protect their content and enhance user experience. AI helps to identify pirated streams, taking them down in a matter of minutes.

By blocking such users, AI is a powerful tool in protecting the monetization of platforms with premium content and AI live streams.

![Live stream on Twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Essential Preparations Before Beginning Your Twitch Streaming Journey

 Whether you're playing games, hosting events, or just chatting, streaming on Twitch is an exciting and rewarding way to engage with your audience in real-time. But to do well on Twitch, you need to prepare properly so your viewers can enjoy watching your content.

To start streaming on Twitch, here's what you'll need:

### Twitch Streaming Software

 First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.

1. **OBS Studio**

 OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.

1. **Twitch Studio**

 Twitch Studio is the official free streaming application developed to simplify the streaming process for new streamers on Twitch. It offers an intuitive interface and pre-made scenes designed to streamline the user experience.

### Streaming equipment

1. **A device to stream from**

 To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you'll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.

 If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:

* **CPU**

 When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.

* **GPU or graphic cards**

 Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU's workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.

1. **Microphone**

 Although you might get by using a gaming headset's built-in microphone for a bit, it's better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.

1. **Webcam**

 If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.

 You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.

S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly.
