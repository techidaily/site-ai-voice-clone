## Get to Know AI Video Translation

**AI video translation** involves translating spoken content in a video from one language to another and offers several benefits.

Most importantly, it can make video content accessible to a global audience. It allows people who speak different languages to understand and enjoy the content, breaking down language barriers. Mainly for educational content, it can be made more accessible to a broader audience. Language courses, lectures, and tutorials can be translated, making it easier for students and learners to access valuable information in their native languages.

Moreover, **AI video translation** is generally more cost-effective and faster than traditional human translation services. It can quickly process and translate large volumes of video content. It is suitable for situations where speed is essential, such as news reporting, emergency broadcasts, and live events.

Ok, there you have it. You can localize video and audio to make your voice heard worldwide in just a few easy steps. Translate audio from video and reach new audiences with the Virbo AI video generator Now!
