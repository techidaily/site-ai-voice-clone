### Language Support

Virbo currently supports translation in the following languages:

 English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, Indonesian, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Italian, Korean, Thai, Filipino, Bengali, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Croatian, Romanian, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Malay, Slovak, Danish, Tamil, Polish, Greek, Finnish, Burmese, Urdu
