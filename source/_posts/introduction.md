Step 3 Upload Your Video

 Once the Video Translator window pops up, click on "Upload the video" you want to work with. Virbo's free plan requires uploads to be 30s to 5min long in MP4 or MOV formats, and a file size of up to 200 MB. Select the original language and a target language that you want your new subtitles to be in.

 Click "Translate" to start the translation process. Virbo will detect the human spoken language in the video and generate the translated video subtitles.

#### Step 1\. Start By Importing Your PPT File

After launching Wondershare Virbo on your desktop, continue to select the "**Create Video**" button. As this opens a pop-up, select the "**Import PPT**" option on the bottom-left to add your PowerPoint file.

![import ppt to convert to video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/guide/windows/powerpoint-to-video-1.jpg)

Choose Import PPT

#### Step 2\. Add Avatars and Voiceover To the PPT Video

![import ppt](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/guide/windows/powerpoint-to-video-3.jpg)
