## Part 2\. Sora Alternative: How To Create Video From Text

 If you're seeking an alternative to Sora for**creating videos from text** , you can try using invideo.io. Invideo.io presents itself as an effective text-to-video generator tool designed to transform textual content effortlessly into video.

InVideo.io features:

* Accessibility through mobile apps for convenient video creation on the go
* Live chat support
* Collaboration tools that facilitate teamwork and shared project management
* An extensive library boasting a diverse collection of videos, stock photos, and music tracks

 How to**create video from text** with ease:

* **Step 1:** Go to the invidio.io website and create an account.

 To**create videos from text** with invideo AI, you'll need to create an account on its[website](https://invideo.io/) . Once you are signed in, access its text-to-video AI tool to begin creating your videos.

![create video from text with invideo AI.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/how-to-generate-videos-from-text-2.jpg)

* **Step 2:** Input the text prompt.

 Once you are on the interface, you can input your prompt. Give clear and detailed instructions for optimal results, and click the "Generate a video" button to proceed.

For example, we will use this prompt to generate the video:

 _A realistic video showcasing the evolution of urban landscapes from the 20th century to the present day, highlighting architectural styles, infrastructure advancements, and societal changes. Incorporate visuals of iconic buildings, city skylines, transportation systems, and cultural landmarks to illustrate the transformation over time._

![Input prompts to generate a video from text.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/how-to-generate-videos-from-text-3.jpg)

* **Step 3:** Adjust the settings.

 The tool will then analyze your text prompt. Then, you’ll get to rename the title and choose the audience, look and feel, as well as which platform to use. Click continue and allow for a few minutes until it is finished generating the video.

![Add further details to create video from text.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/how-to-generate-videos-from-text-4.jpg)

* **Step 4:** Finalize and export the generated video.

## Part 3\. Tips for Writing Prompts To Generate Videos From Text

 The key to**creating AI videos from text** is a good prompt. Unlike text-to-image generators, creating video prompts needs greater detail and clarity. With a good prompt, you can effectively guide the AI model in understanding the desired visual elements, narrative structure, and emotional context of the video.

 Here, we list a few tips to create good prompts for generating videos from text:

1. **Provide context**

 When crafting your AI video prompt, include specific information such as desired style, target audience, intended platform for posting (e.g., YouTube), and preferred tone (e.g., casual or formal). You can also indicate if you want high-definition video, like 4K videos.

1. **Be clear and specific**

 Although providing details is important, avoid unnecessary things that could confuse AI text-to-video generators. Keep your prompt clear and focused to ensure the AI understands your instructions accurately.

1. **Use descriptive language**

 Given that the AI will transform your text into videos, use descriptive language to depict characters, settings, actions, and objects vividly. This will help the AI create a more accurate representation of your vision.

1. **Incorporate keywords**

 Some AI video prompt platforms may support the use of tags or keywords to help generate video according to our intent. Use these keywords to influence the AI's output effectively.

1. **Structure the prompt effectively**

 Organize your prompt in a logical manner to ensure clarity and coherence. Start with an introductory sentence that summarizes the main idea or theme of the video. Then, break down the key elements or scenes you want to include.

 Moreover, pay attention to scene transitions. In case you need multiple scenes, make sure they transition smoothly to maintain a coherent flow when**generating videos from text** .

## Part 4\. How To Convert Video to Text Easily with Video-to-Text Tool

 To elevate your video further, you can convert your video to text easily using[Wondershare Virbo’s Video Translator](https://virbo.wondershare.com/video-translation.html) tool, which functions as a reliable video-to-text generator.
