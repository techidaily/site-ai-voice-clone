 In the next step, you’ll be directed to a new window. Click on the “AI avatars” tab, which opens a dialogue box. You'll find presets of avatars to choose from according to your needs. Afterward, switch the tab by tapping “Background” to modify the product's outlook. Also, add "Stickers" according to the promotion you are offering against your product.

* Step 3\. Generate Scripts for Your Livestreaming Session

 After picking the avatar and background, locate the text box on the left side of the window. Now, type in the preferred text or utilize AI-generated scripts. Conversely, you can also use the services of "Human Interaction," where you only have to add a microphone for live interaction in the “Microphone” section.
