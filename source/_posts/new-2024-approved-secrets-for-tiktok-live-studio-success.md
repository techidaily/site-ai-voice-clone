### Functions of Virbo

1. With Virbo, you can enter your text on the website, and it will turn your words into a voice. Virbo can also read text from files or web links, making it easy to listen to written content.
2. Virbo has over 100 different voices to choose from. Each voice has its own language, accent, gender, and age. You can pick the voice that matches your content's style and essence.
3. Once you choose a voice, you can customize it. You can change its speed, pitch, volume, and pauses. You can adjust sliders to make the voice sound unique, or use special symbols and commands to control how it sounds.
4. You can listen to a preview of your voice creation on the website before you do anything else. If you like it, you can download it as an MP3 file to use in your projects. Whether you're using it for personal or business purposes, Virbo gives you full access to your voice creation.

### Key Features of Virbo

1. Virbo uses advanced AI technology to make voices that don't sound robotic. It understands the context, meaning, and even emotions in the text. This helps it create voices that sound like real humans. Plus, Virbo learns from its interactions, so it keeps getting better over time.
2. It supports many languages and accents, like English, Spanish, French, Chinese, and Japanese. You can easily switch between languages by typing the language code.
3. The app offers different types of voices for different purposes, like storytelling, teaching, podcasts, and games. Each voice category is made to fit a specific role.
4. It lets you add emotions to the voice. You can make it sound happy, sad, angry, calm, and more. By typing emotions in brackets, you can make the voice express different feelings.

 With Virbo, your text becomes a canvas, and the voice you create is like a brushstroke that adds life to your words. You can explore and experiment with different voices, taking your written content on an exciting journey beyond just reading.
