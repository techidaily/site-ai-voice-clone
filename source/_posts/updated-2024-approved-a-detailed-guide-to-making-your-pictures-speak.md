## Part 2\. Difficulties in Talking Photo Technology

![talking photo difficulties](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/02/how-to-make-a-picture-speak-03.jpg)

 Despite its potential,**making your photos talk** encounters numerous challenges that hinder its seamless integration and effectiveness. Here, we outline some difficulties you might encounter:

### ● **Unnatural Mouth Shape**

 Despite advancements in facial recognition and animation, creating natural-looking mouth movements in talking photos remains a significant challenge. The technology often struggles to accurately replicate the intricate movements and subtleties of human speech.

### ● **Unnatural AI Voice**

 Another obstacle lies in the synthesis of natural-sounding AI voices. While text-to-speech (TTS) technology has advanced significantly, AI-generated voices can still sound robotic or unnatural. They often lack the nuances and inflections of human speech. Crafting a voice that is clear and emotionally resonant poses a significant challenge, as it involves capturing human expression and intonation nuances.

### ● **Lack of Lip Non-Actuation in Multi-Person Conversation Photos**

 In multi-person conversation photos, accurately synchronizing lip movements poses a complex challenge. Coordinating lip movements and distinguishing speakers is challenging, especially in dynamic group settings with diverse expressions and speech patterns.

### ● **Technical Limitations**

 Real-time lip-syncing and audio processing require a lot of computer power. Handling large amounts of data while keeping quality needs efficient algorithms. Additionally, it's hard to balance performance and resources in talking photo technology.

### ● **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**

Besides, this method eliminates the need to target customers in-store or via e-mails. Now, businesses can market their product and live sales simultaneously.

#### 2\. Reduced Return Rates and Customer Satisfaction

 Before live selling, people need to search for what they want by visiting the official sites of brands. Also, they scroll to read honest product reviews for the validity of products.
