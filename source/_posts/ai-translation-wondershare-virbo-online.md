### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

## Part 3\. Tips for Effective Translation - How To Translate Correctly With AI Tools

 AI tools are just as good as people using them. If you’re not vigilant and don’t review the output, chances are you will get inaccurate or bad translations. Below are our tips to effectively**translate YouTube video without cc** that can help you get the most out of any AI translation tool.

### 01 Understand the Context

 AI tools often lack a complete understanding of the context. Writing a sentence out of context can totally change the message being conveyed. Therefore, you understand the overall meaning before finalizing a translation draft.

### 02 Clear Up any Ambiguities

 Ambiguous phrases are words in a language that convey more than one meaning, which can lead to inaccurate translations. So, clear up any ambiguous terms or expressions. Selecting a particular meaning of a phrase for your translation requires a keen eye for detail.

### 03 Consider the Cultural Nuances

 Every two cultures are different. This is particularly true if the two are from vastly different geographical regions of the world. So, you have to take into account the cultural nuances of both languages to ensure the translation doesn’t convey unintended meaning.

### 04 Use Reputable & Accurate Tools

 Always use reputable names for your transactions. There’s a good reason why some tools are more popular than others. Take Wondershare Virbo as an example. Virbo provides accurate and better translations for YouTube Videos than most other tools in the market.

### 05 Don’t Be Afraid To Customize

 Sometimes, the translation doesn’t need to be accurate word for word. You can customize the translation to convey the message in a better way. Some AI tools allow customization. You can adjust settings or provide additional context to improve the accuracy of a translation.

### 06 Handle Idioms With Care

 AI tools don’t translate idiomatic expressions in a good way. They translate in a literal way, which destroys the entire message. So, you should be aware of idiomatic expressions and always ready to find their best equivalents in a target language.

### 07 Hire A Human Editor

 If possible, have a human editor take a look and review the translation. The human eye can catch certain nuances that AI might miss. With a human editor, you have the confidence that they will be updated about translations and how to improve the message being conveyed.
