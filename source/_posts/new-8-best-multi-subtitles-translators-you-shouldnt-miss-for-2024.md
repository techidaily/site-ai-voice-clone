## Top 4 Eminem Voice Generator Apps for PC, Mac, Mobile, and Online

 Do you love listening to Eminem's voice? Or do you have friends who cannot have enough of the celebrity's voice? Whichever the case, this article will help you discover the best **Eminem voice generator** . You'll learn to generate Eminem voices using the best text-to-speech generators for mobile, desktop, and online use. Our recommended Eminem voice changers can replicate the celebrity's voice with amazing accuracy.

## **Part 1\. Who is Eminem and What Does He Do?**

 Eminem (Marshall Bruce Mathers III) will feature highly on the list when mentioning legendary musicians. Eminem is an American-born rapper born in 1972\. He is credited for helping popularize hip-hop and is among the best-selling rappers of the 20th and 21st centuries. It's estimated that Eminem has worldwide sales of over 220 million records and was the best-selling musician in the US in the early 2000s.

 That said, Eminem has one of the most unique voices in the music industry. The rapper has managed to change his voice with ease over the years. He is comfortable with low notes and can efficiently ascend as high as possible. Interestingly, David Guetta recently revealed that he used an**AI voice generator for Eminem** to replicate the rapper's voice. This shows just how much AI technology is touching on multiple industries.

## **Part 2\. Reasons Why You Need Eminem AI Voice Generator?**

 Throughout the past few years, more AI-generated content has been introduced in platforms like TikTok, Facebook Reels, YouTube, etc. Today, you can find multiple videos with smooth AI narration in almost any industry. For example, music fans have been transforming popular songs using AI programs to make them sound like they are sung by another person.

 In January, Drayk.it made trending headlines after making Drake songs using AI. However, the platform did not last long and is currently unavailable due to legal issues concerning image rights from the famous Canadian rapper. Several artists and industries have since expressed their dislike for the widespread AI technology.

 With that in mind, below are some of the reasons why you should use an Eminem voice generator:

* Create custom phone and alarm ringtones.
* Narrate funny or motivational video stories with Eminem's voice.
* Practice singing by writing lyrics and finding out how the sentences flow.
* Prank friends online on social media apps like TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.

## **FAQs**

### **1\. What is the best Eminem voice generator program?**

 Many tools allow users to transform their voices into Eminem and other celebrity characters. However, you should consider features like output quality, voice variety, pricing, and more.

 It's important to note that the Eminem AI voices are mainly for entertainment purposes. For example, you cannot use the Eminem voice generator apps to create music, which may result in an expensive lawsuit. However, some apps offer premium plans that allow commercial use.

### **3\. Why should I use an AI voice generator instead of hiring an artist?**

 First, AI voice generators are readily available to download or use online. Also, it would take just a few coins to subscribe to the premium plan, whereas a professional might cost a lot. But all said, always go through your AI voices to ensure there are no errors or left-out words.
