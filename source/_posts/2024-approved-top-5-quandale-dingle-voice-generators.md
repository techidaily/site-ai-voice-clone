## Get To Know OpenAI’s Sora and How To Use It

 The recent release of OpenAI's groundbreaking text-to-video AI generator, Sora, has caused a sensation worldwide.**Sora AI** can produce an ultra-realistic video from text, something that is revolutionizing the way visual content is created.

 While Sora is arguably the most advanced text-to-video AI generator to date, it introduces some huge potential across many industries. Here, we will give you a full review of what OpenAI’s Sorais, what you can do with it, how to use it, and more.

## Part 1\. What Is Sora by OpenAI

[**Sora**](https://openai.com/sora) is a text-to-video generative AI model by OpenAI, which also developed ChatGPT. With **Sora AI** , you can write a text prompt, and it will create a video up to a minute long that matches the description of the prompt.

 Currently, OpenAI is teaching computers to understand and recreate moving things in the real world through**Sora** . The goal is to make computer programs that can help people generate videos involving real-life situations.

![Sora AI video example 1.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/sora-review-1.gif)

### How Sora AI Works

 Similar to other text-to-image generative AI models like DALL·E 3,**Sora** operates as a diffusion model. In simple terms, it begins with each frame of the video being just random noise. Then, through machine learning, it gradually changes these noisy frames into something that matches the prompt description.

 Moreover,**Sora** combines this diffusion model with a “transformer” architecture, similar to what's used in GPT. This combination works well together because diffusion models excel at creating detailed textures, while transformers are better at grasping the big picture.

For example:

![Sora AI video example 2.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/sora-review-2.gif)

**Prompt:**   _Several giant wooly mammoths approach treading through a snowy meadow, their long wooly fur lightly blows in the wind as they walk, snow covered trees and dramatic snow capped mountains in the distance, mid afternoon light with wispy clouds and a sun high in the distance creates a warm glow, the low camera view is stunning capturing the large furry mammal with beautiful photography, depth of field._

### Sora AI Limitations

1. **Lack of Implicit Understanding of Physics**

 Despite its advanced technology, Soradoes not possess built-in knowledge of real-world physics. This problem leads to instances where it may not adhere to expected physical rules.

1. **Difficulty in Representing Cause-and-Effect Relationships**

 Due to its limited understanding, Soramay struggle to accurately depict cause-and-effect scenarios. For example, in a video of an explosion, it might fail to show the subsequent effects in a realistic manner.

1. **Unnatural Shifting of Spatial Positions**

 The Sora AI model may exhibit inconsistencies in positioning objects within the video frames, resulting in unnatural spatial arrangements. This can lead to instances where objects appear suddenly or overlap in unexpected ways.

![Sora AI video example 3.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/sora-review-3.gif)

## Part 2\. What You Can Do With Sora

**Sora AI** offers a wide range of functionalities that cater to diverse creative needs, from crafting videos from scratch to enhancing existing ones. It boasts a range of functionalities that cater to diverse needs and industries.

 Here are some prime applications you can do with**Sora by OpenAI** :

1. **Social media content**

 You can generate engaging video content for platforms like TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube. For instance, Sora can help you create captivating short clips to share stories, showcase products, or entertain your followers.

1. **Advertising and promotion materials**

 With Sora, marketers can produce compelling video advertisements or promotional materials. This text-to-video tool can help craft stunning visuals to capture the audience's attention and convey brand messages.

1. **Training and education materials**

1. **Concept visualization**

![Sora AI video example 4.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/sora-review-4.gif)

## Part 3\. How To Access Sora

 If you are wondering**how to access Sora** , unfortunately, it is still restricted. As of now, Sorais only accessible to a select group of researchers known as the "red team." These experts are tasked with examining the model for any potential issues.

 OpenAI has not provided a definitive[public release date for](https://community.openai.com/t/new-openai-announcement-sora-creating-video-from-text/628159) [**Sora**](https://community.openai.com/t/new-openai-announcement-sora-creating-video-from-text/628159) , but it is anticipated to occur in 2024\. For updates and further details, you can regularly visit the OpenAI website.

## Part 4\. How To Use Sora AI

 When Sora becomes accessible to the public, here’s**how to use Sora** on their website:

* **Step 1:** Write a prompt describing your desired content.
* **Step 2:** The AI model will generate a video with a maximum duration of one minute based on your prompt.
* **Step 3:** To produce longer videos, you might need to extend your prompts and synchronize them with the frame count accordingly.

![How to access Sora](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/sora-review-5.jpg)

## Part 5\. Concerns about Sora AI

 There are valid concerns about the safety and security aspects of**Sora AI** 's advancements. While Sora showcases impressive results, reactions to these developments vary. Many people are feeling worried, particularly about safety protocols and copyright issues.

Some of these concerns include:

* **Inappropriate or harmful content**

 Sora has the potential to generate inappropriate or harmful content without proper safeguards. This could include videos featuring violence, gore, sexually explicit material, derogatory depictions of certain groups, hate imagery, or the promotion of illegal activities.

* **Deepfake technology**

 Sora's ability to create fantastical scenes can also enable the creation of "deepfake" videos. Deepfake technology could be used to create convincing fabricated videos or images depicting individuals engaging in activities they never participated in. This act can lead to reputational damage, blackmail, or harassment.

* **Data privacy and security**

 Sora AI relies on vast amounts of data to generate its content, including images, videos, and text. There are worries about how this data is sourced, stored, and used, especially considering the potential for misuse or exploitation.

 However, OpenAI has assured on its website to prioritize essential safety measures before integrating Sora into its products. For instance, in their products, their text checker will reject prompts that break their rules, like asking for violent, sexual, or hateful content.

 According to their website, OpenAI has also built strong image checkers to review every frame of videos made. They will make sure the AI generator follows the rules before showing them to users.

## Part 6\. Pro Tip: Other Use Cases of AI in Video-to-Text Tool

 Other than text-to-video AI technology like Sora by OpenAI, AI is also used in video-to-text tools that allow its users to produce auto-texts in producing videos, such as video translation. One such tool that uses it is Wondershare Virbo.
