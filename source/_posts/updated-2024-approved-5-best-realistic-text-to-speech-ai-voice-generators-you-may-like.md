6. **Legal and Ethical Boundaries:**  Upholding legal and ethical boundaries is important in all documents. If the video contains any medical records, it is essential to keep them confidential. In case of sensitive information, a translator must follow legal and ethical considerations.
7. **Requirements and Review:**  To achieve perfection, try finding a native translator for proofreading. The translator should follow any specific instructions provided by the client. This covers word count, file format, or reference materials. Besides, deadlines should be followed in handling translation to clients.

## Part 2\. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

 Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers. Colorful and catchy videos grab the attention of the viewers and encourage them to buy the product. The main problem can occur if your target audience cannot understand the language that you have used in videos.

 As we all know, English is one of the most spoken languages. But not everyone speaks or understands it. People can face various problems in understanding the language. That's why video translators play a crucial role in every person's life. If there is no video translator, the world will become dull.
