So, in this post, we want to introduce you to how to use**Voicemod AI voices** to sound differently on video games, VoIP apps, video narrations, and more.

That’s because this program will modulate your voice in real-time, allowing you to shake things up on Discord group chats, Skype video calls, Steam gaming sessions, and other applications. You can even use it to create unique YouTube content and carve out your brand.

## Part II. Features and Capabilities

 You must be asking yourself why we singled out Voicemod AI of all the AI voice modulation programs out there. The thing is that Voicemod comes with special features that can make your voice stand out in the group. Also, this tool is designed to give you a seamless voice-changing session. Let’s look at some of its shining points!

### 1\. Real-time voice modulator

 Voicemod allows you to process voices in real-time, making it the ideal software for streaming on Twitch or making fun calls on Zoom. The AI voice generator has been extensively trained by voices from professional actors to give you human-like narrations. You only need to connect your mic to stream content with**Voicemod AI voice** . We’ll show you how to do that in this guidepost.

### 2\. Extensive variety of voice effects

 Voicemod comes with more than 100 voice effects, with this voice-changing software adding more voices with new updates. The massive library of voice effects and sound modification features means you’ll get unlimited experience with Voicemod. It’s one of the few programs that allows you to modify your voices with reverb, pitch, chorus, vocoder, and other customization features.

### 3\. Create custom voices on VoiceLab

 You can exploit the VoiceLab tool on your Voicemod Pro account to generate custom voices. With it, you can create voices from scratch by combining different audio effects and processors like reverb, pitch shifter, filter, and more. Once you have made a custom voice, proceed to name it, add an avatar, and add it to the voice control panel. This is an excellent way to create unique voices you cannot find anywhere else.

Below is how to change your voice with Voicemod AI:

**Step 1.** Install Voicemod on your Windows 7/10/11 PC or Mac computer and run it.

**![install and run voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-1.jpg)**

**Step 2.** Once you have installed the program successfully, open the sound settings to choose your input and output sound devices.

![enter sound settings on voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-2.jpg)

**Step 3.** Ensure that the**Voice Changer** toggle at the bottom of the Voicemod home window is enabled. Then, click the**Voicebox** tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.

![choose a voice effect on voicemod ai](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-3.jpg)

**Step 4.** If the voice is working, head to the application or browser tab where you want to apply the voice effect to start streaming. That’s it!

**Note:** Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.

#### What Can I Do With ChatGPT?

Users can interact with ChatGPT by asking a wide array of questions and sharing prompts. It's not just about straightforward queries; ChatGPT is designed to engage in creative, informative, and entertaining discussions. Users can seek explanations, brainstorm ideas, get writing assistance, create conversational agents, and much more.

ChatGPT serves as a versatile tool for a myriad of applications:

5. **Language Translation:** Translate phrases and sentences into different languages, bridging communication gaps.

2. **Generating Inaccuracies:** It can sometimes provide incorrect or nonsensical answers that sound plausible.
3. **Sensitive Content:** ChatGPT's responses might inadvertently contain biased or offensive content despite efforts to prevent it.

2. **Rasa:** A framework for building conversational AI, allowing customization of chatbots for specific needs.
3. **IBM Watson Assistant:** An AI-powered chatbot platform that integrates with various business applications.

#### Conclusion
