![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg)

#### Step 3

 After you select a character, you will see their image on the right side of the page. This is where you can customize their appearance and voice settings. Below the character image, you will see an “Edit” button that allows you to change their hair, eyes, mouth, clothes, accessories, and background. You can click on this button and use the sliders and buttons to adjust these features as you like. For example, if you want to make your character look more funny, you can change their hair color, eye shape, mouth expression, etc.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-3.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-3.jpg)

#### Step 4

 Next to the “Edit” button, you will see two drop-down menus that allow you to choose a language and a voice for your character. You can select from over 25 languages and 200 voices that**Oddcast Text to Speech** Tool supports. You can also listen to a sample of each voice by clicking on the speaker icon next to the menu. For example, if you want to create a funny talking avatar of Donald Trump in Spanish, you can select “Spanish” from the language menu and “Jorge” from the voice menu.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-4.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-4.jpg)

#### Step 5

 Below the language and voice menus, you will see four sliders that allow you to adjust the pitch, speed, volume, and effects of your character’s voice. You can use these sliders to make your character sound more funny or realistic. For example, if you want to make your character sound more high-pitched or low-pitched, you can move the pitch slider to the left or right. If you want to make your character sound more fast or slow, you can move the speed slider to the left or right. If you want to make your character sound more loud or soft, you can move the volume slider to the left or right. If you want to add some effects to your character’s voice, such as echo or reverb, you can move the effects slider to the left or right.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-5.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-5.jpg)

#### Step 6

 Below the sliders, you will see a box where you can type or paste your text that you want your character to say aloud. You can use up to 1000 characters per request for this box. You can also use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags to add some pauses, emphasis, or other effects to your speech. SSML is a standard way of controlling how text is spoken by a speech synthesizer. You can use SSML tags by enclosing them in angle brackets (< >). For example, if you want to add a pause of half a second between two words, you can use the tag <break time=“500ms”/> between them. If you want to add some emphasis on a word or phrase, you can use the tag <emphasis> around them.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-6.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-6.jpg)

#### Step 7

 After you type or paste your text in the box, you can click on the “Say It” button below it to hear your character speak your text aloud. You will also see your character’s expressions and movements change according to your text. For example, if your text contains some punctuation marks or emoticons, such as ! ? :) :( etc., your character will show some corresponding emotions and gestures on their face and body.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg)

#### Step 8

 To save or share your funny talking avatar, you can click on the “Download” or “Share” buttons below your character image. The **Oddcast voice** **“Download** ” button allows you to download your avatar as an**Oddcast text to speech** **mp3** audio file or a video file that contains both audio and visual elements of your avatar. The “Share” button allows you to share your avatar via email, Facebook, Twitter, or embed code that you can copy and paste on any website that supports HTML code.
