## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

## Part 4: How to Select the Best Cloning Software in 2024

In the market, there are several **voice cloning software** offering different features. It may be confusing to select a trustworthy and effective voice cloning program. In the following part, we have listed the properties that should be present in the **best voice cloning software**.

### 1\. Natural Voice Quality

The most important factor in any voice cloning app is its ability to create a natural cloned voice. You should run tests to analyze the quality of voices in the software. The voice quality should not be robotic and artificial. It should mimic human-like properties with perfect rhythm, tone, and accent. Moreover, it should include necessary human emotions to add a natural element.

### 2\. Personalized Options and Contextual Understanding

Personalized options help to create a customized cloned voice easily. There should be options to specify the tone, volume, pitch, and sample rate of the voice. Moreover, the tool should be able to understand the context. Through this advanced understanding, the tool can adjust the tone of the voice according to the given situation.

### 3\. Strong Encryption

Sensitive audio recordings that need to be uploaded on voice cloning apps should be protected. The **voice cloning app** should be integrated with encrypted security to protect the user’s data at all costs. Hence, you should select a tool that prioritizes the user’s privacy and security.

### 4\. Multiple Language Support

An ideal **voice clone app** supports multiple languages to target a diverse audience. You should prefer a tool that shows compatibility with different languages and accents. To make content for an international audience, a multilingual voice cloning app can help you.

### 5\. Accuracy and Cost-Effectiveness

There are some distinctive voices comprising unique speaking patterns. The tool should be able to clone such unique voices with high accuracy. Moreover, the software should have affordable pricing plans to match your financial budget. Thus, cost-effectiveness and high accuracy are two important factors that you must look for in a voice cloning app.
