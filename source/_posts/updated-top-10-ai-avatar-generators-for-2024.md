AI advertising can accurately target and make personalized recommendations to users through data analysis and machine learning algorithms. It analyzes users' interests, behaviors, and preferences to deliver relevant and appealing ads, increasing click-through and conversion rates.

#### 2.Real-time optimization and precision

AI advertising can monitor ad performance in real time and optimize it based on user feedback and data metrics. It adjusts ad content, channels, and delivery strategies to improve ad relevance and effectiveness, giving advertisers better control over their ad budgets and outcomes.

#### 3.Automation and efficiency

AI advertising automates ad delivery, reducing manual intervention and labor costs. Advertisers can manage ad campaigns more efficiently and achieve better results by automating ad buying, placement, and optimization.

#### 4.Data-driven insights

AI advertising leverages data analysis and mining to provide deeper insights and decision support. Advertisers can better understand user behavior patterns, market trends, and competitor insights through data analysis, enabling them to make informed advertising decisions.

#### 5.Creative optimization and personalized content creation

Overall, AI advertising harnesses the power of data and algorithms to deliver more accurate, intelligent, and personalized ads, improving ad effectiveness and user experience and generating better performance and returns for advertisers.

## Part 3\. Potential risks and challenges in AI advertising

#### 1.Privacy concerns

AI advertising relies on a large amount of user data for targeting and personalized recommendations, which can raise concerns about user privacy. Improper data handling and usage could lead to data breaches or misuse, resulting in privacy infringements.

#### 2.Bias and discrimination

AI algorithms used in advertising may be influenced by their own biases and prejudices. If algorithms are trained on biased or insufficiently diverse data, it could result in ads that target or exclude specific groups, leading to unfairness and discrimination.

#### 3.Fraud and false information

While AI advertising can predict and prevent fraud, there is still a risk of fraudulent activities and the spread of incorrect information through AI advertising systems. Malicious advertisers may exploit AI technology to deceive users or engage in fraudulent activities, undermining user rights and trust.

#### 4.Lack of human judgment and creativity

Although AI advertising can automate and optimize ad delivery, it may lack human judgment and creativity. Some advertising campaigns require more emotional appeal and creative factors that AI technology may have limitations in delivering.

To address these risks, regulatory agencies and relevant stakeholders need to establish appropriate policies and standards to ensure the compliance and ethicality of AI advertising. Technology developers and advertising practitioners should also strengthen monitoring, validation, and review processes for AI advertising systems to mitigate potential risks and issues.

## Part 1\. How is AI used in advertising?

AI is used in advertising in various ways to optimize campaigns, personalize messaging, and improve targeting. Here are some common applications of AI in advertising:

#### **05**of 08Chatbots and virtual assistants

AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are used in advertising to provide personalized customer support, answer queries, and guide users through the buyer's journey. They can offer recommendations based on user preferences, provide information about products or services, and even complete transactions.

#### **06**of 08Dynamic pricing

![talking photo banner](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What Are Talking Stock Photos and What Can You Do With Them?

 Let’s answer the most pressing question on your mind first. What are talking photos? Talking photos, simply put, are photos brought to life with video and voice. No longer are your photos just images – they can now include voice along with motion. That is one of the several uses of generative artificial intelligence that’s taking the world by storm. With talking photos, not only do you have a memory as image, but you can have the memory with voice and video to make it more life-like. In some uses, this can be deeply comforting to us.

#### 1.1: Uses of Talking Photos

 What can talking photos be used for? Talking photos can be used for fun as well as for interactive education. Here are some uses of talking photos, in a gist:

* An interactive and more engaging learning experience for children.
* Convey emotions better.
* Send personalized messages with voice!
* Capture viewer attention right from the start.

## Part 2: Where Can You Download Talking Stock Photos For Free?

 “Okay, I’m sold on talking photos! Where can I get them?”

 Glad you asked! We have collated a repository of 6 portals that offer quality talking stock photos and talking stock images that you can choose and use!

 **Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

 What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

 What self-respecting journalist or newsreader does not know about Getty Images? Getty has a repertoire of over 7,935,000 high-quality talking photos for you to choose from. That all but guarantees that you will be able to find the ones you want and like.

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

#### 2.3: Unsplash

![unsplash talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-4.jpg)

 Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

#### 2.4: Pexels

![pexels talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-5.jpg)

 Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik

![freepik talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-7.jpg)

 Freepik has been around since 2010 and is part of the Freepik Company that features other brands such as Flaticon, Slidesgo and Wepik. Freepik has over 1,052,000 talking photos for you to choose from.
