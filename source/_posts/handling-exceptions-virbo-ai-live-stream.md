#### Starting/Ending the Live Broadcast

###### Starting the Live Broadcast

* * On the live broadcast editing page, click "Start Broadcasting."  
  * The AI live broadcast window will appear shortly after, displaying the AI live broadcast.

###### Using Your Broadcasting Partner or OBS

###### Note

Keep the AI live broadcast window open on the desktop during the broadcast, or it will not broadcast properly.

* * Open your broadcasting partner or OBS, add a window, select the Wondershare VVB (Live Version) live window.  
  * Click "Start Broadcasting." Use Alt + mouse to crop out the web bar or use the zoom function to remove it.  
  * During the live broadcast, you can only modify the "Artificial Interaction" function; other broadcast settings cannot be changed.

###### Ending the Broadcast

* * When concluding the live broadcast, initiate the termination of the live stream on the platform's broadcasting partner first, followed by clicking the "End Live" button on Virbo Live to finalize the shutdown process.
