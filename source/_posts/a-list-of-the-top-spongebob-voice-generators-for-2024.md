Afterward, switch the tab by tapping “Background” to modify the product's outlook. Also, add "Stickers" according to the promotion you are offering against your product.

* Step 3\. Generate Scripts for Your Livestreaming Session

 After picking the avatar and background, locate the text box on the left side of the window. Now, type in the preferred text or utilize AI-generated scripts.
