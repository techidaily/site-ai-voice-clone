#### Alibaba International

###### Operational Steps

* **Prepare Equipment, Network, and Browser**
* **Install Virtual Sound Card**  
  * Due to audio restrictions on Alibaba International, a virtual sound card is required. If your computer's sound device has a "stereo mix," it can be used as an alternative. Check the path: My Computer - Properties - Sound - Sound Control Panel - Recording.
* **Set Up "Stereo Mix"**  
  * Skip this step if using a virtual sound card.  
  * Click My Computer - Properties - Sound - Sound Control Panel - Recording, activate stereo sound effects, and set it as default.  
  * Click Properties - Listen, select your speaker device, and click OK.  
  * Confirm the settings by playing a video on your computer. If both speakers and the microphone show sound detection, the setup is successful.
* **Download and Install OBS**  
  * As Alibaba International has restrictions on webcams, OBS is needed as a virtual camera (future Virbo Live product features will support this).  
  * After installation, go to Settings - Video and change the resolution to "1080x1920." Select the "+" sign - Window Capture, and add the window of the Live Explosion (Live Version).  
  * Crop the URL bar by holding Ctrl + left-click. Click "Start Virtual Camera."
* **Prepare Materials**
* **Initiate the Live Stream**
* **Start Live Streaming on Alibaba Seller's Live Companion**  
  * Log in to Alibaba Seller, open the live stream, and the Alibaba Live Companion window will pop up.  
  * Choose "Free Mode," add the camera, select Logitech c930e, and display it to cover the entire screen.

### How Sora AI Works

 Similar to other text-to-image generative AI models like DALL·E 3,**Sora** operates as a diffusion model. In simple terms, it begins with each frame of the video being just random noise. Then, through machine learning, it gradually changes these noisy frames into something that matches the prompt description.

 Moreover,**Sora** combines this diffusion model with a “transformer” architecture, similar to what's used in GPT. This combination works well together because diffusion models excel at creating detailed textures, while transformers are better at grasping the big picture.

For example:

![Sora AI video example 2.](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/sora-review-2.gif)

**Prompt:**   _Several giant wooly mammoths approach treading through a snowy meadow, their long wooly fur lightly blows in the wind as they walk, snow covered trees and dramatic snow capped mountains in the distance, mid afternoon light with wispy clouds and a sun high in the distance creates a warm glow, the low camera view is stunning capturing the large furry mammal with beautiful photography, depth of field._

### Sora AI Limitations

1. **Lack of Implicit Understanding of Physics**

 Despite its advanced technology, Soradoes not possess built-in knowledge of real-world physics. This problem leads to instances where it may not adhere to expected physical rules.

1. **Difficulty in Representing Cause-and-Effect Relationships**

 Due to its limited understanding, Soramay struggle to accurately depict cause-and-effect scenarios. For example, in a video of an explosion, it might fail to show the subsequent effects in a realistic manner.

1. **Unnatural Shifting of Spatial Positions**

 The Sora AI model may exhibit inconsistencies in positioning objects within the video frames, resulting in unnatural spatial arrangements. This can lead to instances where objects appear suddenly or overlap in unexpected ways.

## Part 5\. Concerns about Sora AI

 There are valid concerns about the safety and security aspects of**Sora AI** 's advancements. While Sora showcases impressive results, reactions to these developments vary. Many people are feeling worried, particularly about safety protocols and copyright issues.

* **Inappropriate or harmful content**

 Sora has the potential to generate inappropriate or harmful content without proper safeguards. This could include videos featuring violence, gore, sexually explicit material, derogatory depictions of certain groups, hate imagery, or the promotion of illegal activities.

* **Deepfake technology**

 Sora's ability to create fantastical scenes can also enable the creation of "deepfake" videos. Deepfake technology could be used to create convincing fabricated videos or images depicting individuals engaging in activities they never participated in. This act can lead to reputational damage, blackmail, or harassment.

* **Data privacy and security**

 Sora AI relies on vast amounts of data to generate its content, including images, videos, and text. There are worries about how this data is sourced, stored, and used, especially considering the potential for misuse or exploitation.

 However, OpenAI has assured on its website to prioritize essential safety measures before integrating Sora into its products. For instance, in their products, their text checker will reject prompts that break their rules, like asking for violent, sexual, or hateful content.

 According to their website, OpenAI has also built strong image checkers to review every frame of videos made. They will make sure the AI generator follows the rules before showing them to users.
