## Part 1: How Many English Accents are Available All Over The World

 English has become one of the most commonly recognized languages around the world. Many countries across the globe speak English as a first or second language. The diversity of English language accents lies specifically in this fact. This is also proof of the language’s adaptability and rich cultural history.

 Assigning an exact number to the English accents spoken globally is challenging. Accents vary greatly with regions. Sometimes even the same city can produce multiple accents of the same language.

## Part 2: What Are The Reasons Behind Different English Accents

 Several factors contribute to the incredible diversity found in the English language. A range of features can influence accents, some of which include the following:

### 1\. Migration, Travel, and Settlements

 Throughout history, the world has seen many languages spread across the world. Travel has always been one of the primary reasons. Isolated communities often develop distinct accents due to limited interactions. More commonly, English-speaking populations have migrated and settled in various regions, blending the local language and native English accents. Due to this mixing, new and unique accents emerge.

### 2\. Colonization and Imperialism

 The British Empire's expansion era resulted in several colonial settlements. As a result, English was spread to numerous territories and far-off places in the world. The amalgamation of English with local languages and dialects gave rise to unique accents such as Indian and African English.

### 3\. Media and Entertainment

 Media has always been a powerful communication and a great way to spread your word. People often copy speech patterns observed in mainstream media and entertainment. These include movies, TV shows, and music. This can lead to the development of certain distinct accents and dialects. This particularly occurs in regions that have high media exposure.

### 4\. Education and Socioeconomic Factors

 Certain accents have been associated with distinct socioeconomic factors. Higher levels of education are often associated with more standardized and prestigious accents. Other influences such as occupation, social identity, and community also play a key role in determining the varying accents of individuals.

### 5\. Linguistic Drifts and Age

 Linguistic drift is a natural process that helps languages evolve. Like most languages, English has also undergone linguistic drift. This phenomenon has caused notable changes in various language features. These changes can be of phonological and grammatical nature. As a result, several variations have occurred in accents and dialects.
