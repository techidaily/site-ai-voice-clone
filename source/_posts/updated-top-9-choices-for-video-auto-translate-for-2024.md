#### Limitations

* **Coqui TTS voice cloning** and other features of this tool take too much time to process files.
* Other than that, the XTTS version of this tool is slower than their core TTS technology. It is still an underdeveloped platform, which contains some bugs or compatibility issues.
* Users need to learn the XTTS coding language for this tool before using any of its advanced features.
* This deep learning tool for speech cloning requires a lot of data processing resources to run.

## Part 3: Master Coqui TTS Voice Cloning: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Imagine that you are a short-film producer who does not have many voice actors for their movie. What you should use is the **Coqui TTS Voice Cloning** feature to produce impressive voices. Thus, let's discover what steps to take to create a perfect cloned voice:

##### Step 1 Access the Tool

First, launch [Hugging Face's](https://huggingface.co/) official website to initiate the process. Then, hit the “Spaces” tab from the above toolbar and search for Coqui. Afterward, select the "[CoquiTTS (Official)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/coqui/CoquiTTS)" tool uploaded by Coqui and access its interface.

##### Step 2 Convert Text to Speech

After accessing the interface, type the desired text that you want to listen to in the cloned voice using the “Text Prompt” box. You can select the preferred language that you want to use for this text.

##### Step 3 Clone Your Own Voice

You can upload a preferably 6-second audio recording in the interface as a reference audio simply by dragging and dropping. You can even record it directly using the “Record a microphone" button if you don't have a recording file.
