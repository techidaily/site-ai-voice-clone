 While the tools above offer exciting possibilities, it’s important to understand their limitations. Here are some considerations when choosing a real-time video translation app. This way, when you use these tools, you’ll know what to expect and what might have some challenges.

Accuracy

 Even the best human translators sometimes struggle with complex sentences, slang, or thick accents. Real-time translation of videos using AI is similar. While it’s constantly learning, it might misunderstand some things. So, keep things simple and clear in your videos, especially if your audience might need real-time translation.

Latency

 Imagine you’re having a conversation, but there’s a slight pause between your words and the other person’s response. It throws things off a bit, right? That’s kind of what latency is like in**real-time video translation** . There’s a short delay between what’s spoken and the translated text appearing. For critical conversations, consider using pre-recorded videos with translated subtitles or voiceovers.

Supported Languages

 Apps that translate videos in real-time are getting better at handling a wider range of languages, but some are more supported than others. Check the app you’re considering and the languages it supports. If your language isn’t on the list, you might need to look for alternative solutions.

![app supported languages illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/real-time-video-translation-10.jpg)

## Conclusion

**Real-time video translation** tools are breaking down language barriers faster. Imagine watching a foreign news report and understanding it instantly or conversing with someone who speaks another language live.

 The apps listed here are powerful, but choosing the right one depends on your needs. If you want to understand the content, real-time translation is perfect. But consider AI voice cloning if you need to create videos with a specific voice.

 For seamless real-time translation, check out Virbo. It’s a great option to help you bridge the language gap and connect with the world in a new way.

 For those who love to spend their time texting and chatting, this feature can really help add a fun element to your conversations. Just imagine your friends receiving a video of your voice emanating from your animated avatar! If you are curious, let’s see**how to make talking emoji on iPhone** .

## Part 1\. What is iPhone Talking Emoji or Animoji?

 Animoji is an Apple feature that transforms specific emoji icons into short, customized animations using your facial expressions and voice.

## Part 2\. How Does iPhone Talking Emoji Work?

 Ever tried those fun Snapchat lenses? The**talking emoji on Apple** devices works in a similar fashion to Snapchat lenses. But instead of relying on custom masks from Snapchat, it uses popular emojis.

 Animoji takes advantage of the TrueDepth camera system and the iPhone's internal chip to use Face ID technology. Apple first introduced Face ID in 2017 with the iPhone X. Now, all newer iPhone models come equipped with Face ID.

 So you can use and make Animoji on iPhone X or later. You can also use it on the iPad Pro 11-inch or the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) and newer models.
