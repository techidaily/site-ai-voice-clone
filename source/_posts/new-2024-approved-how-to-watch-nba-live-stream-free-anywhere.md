2. It supports many languages and accents, like English, Spanish, French, Chinese, and Japanese. You can easily switch between languages by typing the language code.
3. The app offers different types of voices for different purposes, like storytelling, teaching, podcasts, and games. Each voice category is made to fit a specific role.
4. It lets you add emotions to the voice. You can make it sound happy, sad, angry, calm, and more. By typing emotions in brackets, you can make the voice express different feelings.

 With Virbo, your text becomes a canvas, and the voice you create is like a brushstroke that adds life to your words. You can explore and experiment with different voices, taking your written content on an exciting journey beyond just reading.
