## Part 1\. A Basic Preview To "Live Shopping"

**Livestream selling** or live shopping refers to live product demonstrations on digital platforms. The retailer or host has to introduce themselves, their store, and sale before describing products.

As**live selling** has a core element of being in real time, people can question and know about the product. Compared with traditional shopping, one can place an order through links mentioned in the livestream.

### Is It Beneficial To Sell Live in This Digital Industry?

 Live selling is an emerging way to attract customers to shop on online marketplaces. According to [research](#:~:text=76%25%20of%20US%20adults%20shop,at%20least%20once%20per%20week.) , 76% of US adults prefer shopping online for clothes and groceries. It focuses on customers’ desire to know about products that generate sales. Thus, it proves beneficial in many terms, among which a few are elaborated below:

#### 1\. Engaging and Updating Communication

 Businesses can directly engage with a broader audience by entering the live selling industry. They get knowledge about current product trends to introduce similar things. Besides, this method eliminates the need to target customers in-store or via e-mails. Now, businesses can market their product and live sales simultaneously.

#### 2\. Reduced Return Rates and Customer Satisfaction

 Before live selling, people need to search for what they want by visiting the official sites of brands. Also, they scroll to read honest product reviews for the validity of products. With live selling, customers can view the products and ask questions during the live sessions. Therefore, it lowers the return rates to 40% while increasing customer satisfaction and trust.

#### 3\. Potential Growth and Virtual Demonstrations

 This online shopping mode has the potential to upscale your business. According to a survey, companies can see top-line growth upward of 25% through live selling.

Many brands are integrating social media with e-commerce to cut the need for two separate apps.

### 2\. Real-Time Session With Host

 Upon choosing a suitable platform, a live video session is arranged. For that purpose, you need a host who should seem trustworthy and relatable to the product. There could be more than one person in the live sale to demonstrate products and share tips and benefits. Besides, the host needs to interact with the customers and share thoughts about the product.

### 3\. Points of Product or Video Content

 The main object of live selling is to sell products, but the best way is to create hype. In this regard, brands offer special discounts and giveaways valid only during live streams. It increases the tendency of customers to make purchases during the live sessions. The live session must be 20-30 minutes and include click-on links for easy buying.
