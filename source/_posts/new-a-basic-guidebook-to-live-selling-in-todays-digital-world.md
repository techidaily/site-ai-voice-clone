## Part 1\. A Basic Preview To "Live Shopping"

**Livestream selling** or live shopping refers to live product demonstrations on digital platforms. The retailer or host has to introduce themselves, their store, and sale before describing products. They explain each detail of the products and their prices while holding them in a direct video call. During that, ensure that followers can see the product and interact through comments.

 Customers perceive it as a lively shopping experience instead of websites loading products. It creates a sense of connection as people feel like shopping in physical stores. As**live selling** has a core element of being in real time, people can question and know about the product. Compared with traditional shopping, one can place an order through links mentioned in the livestream.

### Is It Beneficial To Sell Live in This Digital Industry?

 Live selling is an emerging way to attract customers to shop on online marketplaces.

It focuses on customers’ desire to know about products that generate sales. Thus, it proves beneficial in many terms, among which a few are elaborated below:

#### 1\. Engaging and Updating Communication

 Businesses can directly engage with a broader audience by entering the live selling industry. They get knowledge about current product trends to introduce similar things. Besides, this method eliminates the need to target customers in-store or via e-mails. Now, businesses can market their product and live sales simultaneously.

#### 2\. Reduced Return Rates and Customer Satisfaction

 Before live selling, people need to search for what they want by visiting the official sites of brands. Also, they scroll to read honest product reviews for the validity of products. With live selling, customers can view the products and ask questions during the live sessions. Therefore, it lowers the return rates to 40% while increasing customer satisfaction and trust.

### 2\. Real-Time Session With Host

 Upon choosing a suitable platform, a live video session is arranged. For that purpose, you need a host who should seem trustworthy and relatable to the product. There could be more than one person in the live sale to demonstrate products and share tips and benefits. Besides, the host needs to interact with the customers and share thoughts about the product.

### 3\. Points of Product or Video Content

## What Is an AI Art Generator?

## Part 1\. What is an AI art generator?

An AI art generator is a software or system that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to create or assist in creating art. It uses machine learning algorithms, and intense learning models, to analyze and understand various artistic styles, designs, and patterns. By training on large datasets of existing artwork, an AI art generator learns to generate new, original artwork that imitates or extends upon the available styles.

AI art generators can produce various art forms, including paintings, drawings, digital art, and multimedia installations. They can generate artwork from scratch or assist artists by providing suggestions, enhancing creative workflows, and exploring new possibilities. AI art generators can also be used as tools for artistic exploration, enabling artists to experiment with different styles, combinations, and variations.

The generated art results from a collaboration between the AI system and the artist or user. The AI provides suggestions and inspirations or even autonomously creates art pieces based on given parameters or prompts. The artist or user can refine, modify, or incorporate the generated artwork into their creative process.

AI art generators have sparked new debates and discussions around the definition of art, creativity, and the role of machines in artistic expression. They are a fascinating example of how artificial intelligence can be applied in artistic creation, pushing the boundaries of traditional artistic practices and opening up new avenues for creative exploration and innovation.
