You have understood how Virbo is better than the **Veed.io translation** tool. Let’s analyze the method you can use to translate videos using this tool.

Step 1 Enter the Video Translator Feature from the Home Tab

Once you download Virbo from its official website, launch this Veed.io alternative on your computer. Next, hit the “Video Translator” button from its main interface after accessing the "Home" tab.

Step 2 Import Your Video to Start the Video Translation Process

Step 4 Optimize the Advanced Video Translation Settings

Now, you can adjust the advanced settings for your video translation process. For this purpose, turn on the Subtitle option to get the video subtitles translated along with the audio. Also, enable the Lip-Sync option to generate translated audios that align with the video. Finally, hit the Translate This Video button to get your desired translated video.
