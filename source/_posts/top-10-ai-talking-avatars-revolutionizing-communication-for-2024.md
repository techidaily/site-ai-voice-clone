![understanding more about instagram live shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-understanding-instagram-live-shopping-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. Instagram Live Shopping: Things Users Need To Know

 Businesses on Instagram used to utilize live broadcasts to sell products directly from the app. It allows them to interact with viewers and drive real-time engagement. Instagram live shopping allowed people to save videos so customers could shop after the broadcast. Using this feature helped companies humanize their brand by telling stories.

 According to a[report](https://business.instagram.com/blog/instagram-live-shopping-reach-customers) , many Instagram users shopped weekly on the platform. They utilized many features like shopping tags and the “Shop” tab. However, Instagram stopped supporting live shopping on March 16, 2023\. It was decided so that Instagram could focus more on other features of their application.

### Reason for Discontinuing Live Shopping Feature

**Live shopping on Instagram** depends on the product quality. About 55% of the customers reported having this issue with live shopping. There are various other drawbacks to Instagram's live selling feature, which are provided as follows:

1. **More Focus on Other Features:** Instagram wanted to focus on other app features. For this reason, they discontinued live shopping, which required utmost attention.
2. **Declining Engagement:** After the pandemic, online users became less engaged with livestream shopping. So, Instagram shifted its focus to the Reels feature.
3. **Customer Feedback:** The comments and suggestions on the live streams demanded improvements. Also, the**live-selling Instagram** feature did not bear positive comments from the customers.
4. **Lack of Communication:** Sometimes, the online team cannot properly communicate with customers. The lack of communication causes confusion and dissatisfaction among customers.
