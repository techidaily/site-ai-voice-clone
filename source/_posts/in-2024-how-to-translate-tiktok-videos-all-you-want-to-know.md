TikTok has realized the power of streaming and is now competing with some of the biggest platforms like Facebook Live, Twitch, and YouTube.

 But if you want to grow your TikTok using the Live Studio, then we have a complete guideline of how to go from a beginner streamer to an advanced one.

## Part 1: Basic Knowledge of Pro Tips for TikTok Live Studio Success

![TikTok Studio Live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/secrets-for-tiktok-live-studio-success-1.jpg)

So how does it work?

### 01 How does TikTok Live Studio work?

 Being a comprehensive live streaming software, creators who want to use Live Studio will need to at least have 1000 followers to unlock and access this wonderful software. TikTok LIVE Studio has helped gaming creators up their TikTok Live experience, experience true monetization, and connect deeply with their viewers.

 However, if you want to be a gaming-related creator, you must have posted game-related short videos or gone live while playing a game of your choice. But with non-gamers, the policy is different. You need at least 10,000 followers to have access to the LIVE Studio.

### 02 Benefits and Features of TikTok Live Studio

**Tik Tok LIVE Studio** provides many features that make streaming a breeze. Especially when you are a gamer, you get so many intuitive controls that it turns your TikTok into an analytical dashboard where you can understand your audience a bit better.

 One of the best ways to promote is simply to make an engaging TikTok that only teases the content of your upcoming live session, sparking the curiosity factor amongst the potential viewers.

### 4\. Timing matters the most

 The right time when you push out your content is what matters the most. The same is true with YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and most other platforms. With TikTok, you must understand where your audience is mostly active in

 How do you find that? Well, you need to understand your audience deeply and when they are mostly active. For example, your audience could be active on TikTok on a certain time and that’s where pushing your livestream will get the most results.

### 5\. Take care of technical aspects
