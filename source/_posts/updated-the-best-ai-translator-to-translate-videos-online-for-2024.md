## Part 2\. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

 Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers. Colorful and catchy videos grab the attention of the viewers and encourage them to buy the product. The main problem can occur if your target audience cannot understand the language that you have used in videos.

 As we all know, English is one of the most spoken languages. But not everyone speaks or understands it. People can face various problems in understanding the language. That's why video translators play a crucial role in every person's life. If there is no video translator, the world will become dull. Let's discuss some challenges that can occur if video translators do not exist.

### 1.Communication Gap Formed

 If your viewers understand the Spanish language, but you are creating videos in other languages. It will create a communication barrier because your audience does not understand the language in the video. Language barriers can affect communication and lead to misunderstandings. Suppose you are posting video lectures on the website to offer courses. In this case, if you don't use a video language translator, it will misinterpret the viewers.

![Virbo allows export high-quality videos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/free-online-video-translator-4.jpg)

### 2\. Failed to Reach a Large Audience

 In this modern world, people create videos for marketing purposes. What happens if the translators do not come into our lives? If your target is to reach a large audience that will see your videos and love your content, then you need a video translator.

## Part 2\. Difficulties in Talking Photo Technology

![talking photo difficulties](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/02/how-to-make-a-picture-speak-03.jpg)

 Despite its potential,**making your photos talk** encounters numerous challenges that hinder its seamless integration and effectiveness. Here, we outline some difficulties you might encounter:

### ● **Unnatural Mouth Shape**

 Despite advancements in facial recognition and animation, creating natural-looking mouth movements in talking photos remains a significant challenge. The technology often struggles to accurately replicate the intricate movements and subtleties of human speech.

### ● **Unnatural AI Voice**

 Another obstacle lies in the synthesis of natural-sounding AI voices. While text-to-speech (TTS) technology has advanced significantly, AI-generated voices can still sound robotic or unnatural.

 In multi-person conversation photos, accurately synchronizing lip movements poses a complex challenge. Coordinating lip movements and distinguishing speakers is challenging, especially in dynamic group settings with diverse expressions and speech patterns.
