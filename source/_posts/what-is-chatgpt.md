### Tool 6: [Talkr](https://talkrapp.com/)

Talkr is an iOS app to generate a **talking photo album** on your iPhone or iPad. This app comes in two modes – Talkr Live and Talkr Classic. With the Live mode, you can record your camera on iPhone X or newer while talking like your favorite celebrity or any other character. It allows you to enter texts or audio to create a talking snapshot. On the other hand, Talkr Classic enables you to upload a local photo and customize it with your favorite voices. The only drawback is that you'll have to download these apps separately.

Simply select a photo from your local storage, and then the program will scan the face before allowing simple editing. You can edit your voice with different effects to make it funnier or change the language to multiple options.
