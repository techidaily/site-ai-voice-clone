### 02 Benefits and Features of TikTok Live Studio

**Tik Tok LIVE Studio** provides many features that make streaming a breeze. Especially when you are a gamer, you get so many intuitive controls that it turns your TikTok into an analytical dashboard where you can understand your audience a bit better.
