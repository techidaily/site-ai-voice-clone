But this is 2024, and today, we introduce you to talking photos or talking stock images. Literally, photos that speak. What! Read more about it below!

![talking photo banner](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What Are Talking Stock Photos and What Can You Do With Them?

 Let’s answer the most pressing question on your mind first. What are talking photos? Talking photos, simply put, are photos brought to life with video and voice. No longer are your photos just images – they can now include voice along with motion. That is one of the several uses of generative artificial intelligence that’s taking the world by storm. With talking photos, not only do you have a memory as image, but you can have the memory with voice and video to make it more life-like. In some uses, this can be deeply comforting to us.

#### 1.1: Uses of Talking Photos

 What can talking photos be used for? Talking photos can be used for fun as well as for interactive education. Here are some uses of talking photos, in a gist:

* An interactive and more engaging learning experience for children.
* Convey emotions better.
* Send personalized messages with voice!
* Capture viewer attention right from the start.
* Create memories by adding voice to photos for a more vivid memory experience!
* Your social media shares can become that much more interesting and engaging.
* Presentations and financial charts and graphs could be made easier to understand.

 Glad you asked! We have collated a repository of 6 portals that offer quality talking stock photos and talking stock images that you can choose and use!

 **Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

 What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

 What self-respecting journalist or newsreader does not know about Getty Images? Getty has a repertoire of over 7,935,000 high-quality talking photos for you to choose from. That all but guarantees that you will be able to find the ones you want and like.

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

#### 2.3: Unsplash

![unsplash talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-4.jpg)

 Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

#### 2.4: Pexels

 Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik

![freepik talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-7.jpg)

## Translate Video From Japanese to English Online for Free

 Let’s say you’re a business owner or a content creator in Japan. If you want to broaden your horizons, you may need to**translate videos from Japanese to English** . This is because English is spoken globally. You can sell more, share knowledge, and connect with English speakers worldwide.

 For streaming platforms, turning Japanese content into English is a ticket to reaching audiences all over the globe. And businesses using Japanese tech might need translated training videos for their remote workers.

 Seeing this growing need, it’s clear you need effective video translation solutions. So, we’ve created a guide to help you choose the best method for each step, including using AI. Finding the right way to translate videos is important, so keep reading!

![listening to a video while writing](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-video-japanese-to-english-01.jpg)

## Part I. Completed Process To Translate Videos From Japanese to English

 When you want to**translate a video from Japanese to English** , you can follow some general steps, no matter how you decide to do it. Let’s break down each step for you:

* **Step 1:** Video Transcription

 Before you can translate, you need to understand what’s being said. So, the initial step is to do a video transcription. You can either hire professionals or use a Japanese-to-English video translator app to convert the spoken language to text.

 Transcription captures all the Japanese dialogue, ensuring the English translation is spot-on. Having the text file lets you edit it, like shortening sentences or adjusting cultural references. This results in a smoother and more natural English video for you.

* **Step 2:** Translation

 Once you have the transcript, you can translate the Japanese text into English. A good translation ensures the original message is accurately conveyed in the new language. It avoids any misunderstandings or misinterpretations for your English viewers. You have two options to do it. Both have strengths and weaknesses, so let’s see which suits your needs best.

* **Professional Human Translation Services**

 When you want to translate a video from Japanese to English, a pro can make the sentences sound right for your audience. These professionals tweak the tone to be natural and engaging. If you go to translation agencies, they make sure the work is top-notch by going through strict editing and reviewing. However, human translation services cost more and take a bit more time than machine translation tools.

* **Machine Translation Tools**

 Machine translation tools are fast and affordable. They can be a good option for short, simple videos where perfect accuracy isn’t critical. But it often struggles with complex language, cultural references, and humor.

* **Step 3:** Timing and Implementation

 Let’s talk about making the Japanese to English video translation seamless. After translating, you want the words to match the original rhythm and pace of the speaker in the video. It keeps things feeling natural and engaging for you, the viewer. Plus, speakers use non-verbal cues like jokes, emotions, and pauses. Matching the translated text with these visual cues keeps the video’s meaning and impact intact.

 How to do it? Professional workflows often use timecode, which gives each video frame a unique timestamp. It ensures super precise subtitle placement for that perfect synchronization. Some video editing tools even have “waveforms” to help visually line up subtitles with the spoken parts.

![editing a video using a software](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-video-japanese-to-english-02.jpg)

 Here are several ways to add the translated Japanese text to your video:

* **Subtitles**

 Subtitles are like on-screen translators for you. They show the English dialogue while the original Japanese audio goes on. It helps you understand if you get the visuals but not the language. The focus is on getting the main point across and sometimes making the sentences shorter for easier reading.

* **Closed Captions**

 Like subtitles, closed captions (CC) are words shown on the screen. They go beyond spoken words, covering all the sounds you hear, like dialogue, music, and even background noises. The main goal is to help you, especially if you’re deaf or struggle with hearing. So, if you’re aiming for videos everyone can enjoy, try a video translator from Japanese to English with CC capabilities.

* **Dubbing**

 Dubbing is a more intricate process where the original Japanese audio track is completely replaced. Voice actors step in to record the translated script in English. They try to sync up their words with the lip movements of the characters on screen. It makes it seem like the characters speak English right from the start, giving you a more immersive viewing experience.

* **Voiceover**

 In this method, a narrator reads the translated script in English over the original Japanese audio. It’s often used in documentaries or educational videos when you need more info beyond just the dialogue.

* **Step 4:** Final Review and Approval

 Alright, so you’re at the last step now. You’re giving the translated video a good check to ensure everything’s spot-on – accurate, consistent, and top-notch quality. It means looking out for any problems in the translation, timing, or how you choose to do it. Once you give the thumbs up to the final version, you’ve got a smooth and effective English video ready for your audience.

 You might find the previous steps tedious and time-consuming. But what if you could translate your video from Japanese to English in minutes? That way, you could reach new markets and expand your influence faster. AI video translators like[Wondershare Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/) can help you spread your work, passions, and stories to a global audience. Read on to learn more.

 You can’t always**translate a video from Japanese to English** without a few difficulties. Here are some ways to make the process easier for you:

Divide the Script Into Manageable Chunks

 Break down the script into smaller sections like sentences, phrases, or even shorter segments depending on the video’s pace and complexity. It allows for more precise timing adjustments later.

Use a “Shadowing” Technique

 As you watch the video, read the translated text out loud. Adjust the subtitle timing to match how you naturally speak. Doing this makes the flow feel more natural for you and the viewers.

Test and Refine

 Now that you’ve set the timing for the subtitles, it’s time to put them to the test with your target audience. This step is important because it helps you catch any timing problems, awkward phrasing, or cultural differences that might have slipped through during editing.

 Listen to what your audience says, and then use that feedback to tweak the subtitles. Your goal is to make sure they’re clear, short, and match the audience’s culture.

AI for Pre-Translation Tasks

 Take advantage of AI tools for speech-to-text conversion and automatic subtitle generation. It can save time, but always proofread for accuracy and natural flow.

File Compatibility

 Ensure your chosen translation service or tool supports the format of your video file. The common formats include MP4, MOV, and AVI.

## Conclusion

 So you’ve seen how easy it can be to translate a video from Japanese to English. It’s up to you whether you will ask for the help of human translators, video editors, or AI video translators.

 As you know, Virbo goes beyond being a basic**Japanese to English video translator and converter** . It takes the complexity out of translation, offering seamless and accurate results.

 But remember, even the best AI translation can benefit from a human touch. Don’t be afraid to experiment and refine your translated video for the best outcome. With a little effort, you can bridge the language barrier and share your Japanese video content with the world.
