![Add sound to start recording TikTok video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-2.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Choose the duration and the part of the song.

 After choosing the song you want, you will return to the recording screen. Here, select your video duration at the bottom of the screen. You can choose between 10 minutes, 60 seconds, and 15 seconds. Remember that the duration of the songs on TikTok is usually only 30 to 60 seconds.

![Set the duration of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-3.jpg)

* **Step 4.** Choose the part of the song.

 TikTok allows you to change the part of the song when lip-sync. However, the duration of the video should be less than the duration of the chosen song.

 To do this, click on the song's name at the top of your screen. Then, the bottom of your screen will display your chosen song. Tap the scissor icon and slide the playback to change the part of the song. Click “Done” once you have finished editing.

* **Step 5.** Tap on the red button.

 If you are ready to record, tap the red button at the bottom of your screen. Then TikTok will play the chosen part of the song and record your lip-sync simultaneously. You can pause and continue the recording by clicking the same red button.

 Creating a video on TikTok by lip-syncing is a fun and creative way to express yourself and connect with others. By following the steps above, you can create a lip-sync video on the TikTok app with ease. Keep in mind that by using these steps, you need to memorize the sentences and understand the beat of the chosen songs.

## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

 On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 2.** Delay the recording

 On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

![Set a timer to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-8.jpg)

* **Step 3.** Start the recording

 Then click “Start recording” to record the video with the timer on.

### Method 3: Use a Photo Talking Tool

 Next, consider using a Talking Photo feature by Wondershare Virbo. This method is for you who want to create engaging TikTok lip-sync videos without memorizing the words.

## Demystifying AI Game Generators | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. Explanation of what AI game generators are

An AI game generator is a cutting-edge software or system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automate and enhance various aspects of game development. It harnesses the power of machine learning, neural networks, and other AI methodologies to create, design, or assist in the creation of video games. Unlike traditional game development methods that heavily rely on manual design and coding, AI game generators offer a more automated and efficient approach.

## Part 2\. How do AI game generators differ from traditional game development methods?

AI game generators differ significantly from traditional game development methods in several key ways

### 1\. Automation and Efficiency

AI game generators automate various aspects of game development, such as content creation and level design, reducing the need for manual work.  
Traditional methods involve manual coding and design, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

### 2\. Speed of Development

AI game generators can rapidly generate game content and prototypes, speeding up development.  
Traditional methods may require extensive coding, design, and testing, leading to longer development cycles.

### 3\. Creativity and Innovation

AI game generators can introduce novel and unexpected elements by analyzing existing game data and patterns.  
Traditional methods use human creativity to design characters, levels, and gameplay mechanics.

### 4\. Personalization and Dynamic Content

AI game generators enable dynamic and personalized experiences by generating content based on player interactions.  
Traditional methods provide static content that's designed and coded beforehand.

### 5\. Resource Constraints

AI game generators can help smaller teams or indie developers overcome resource limitations by automating various tasks.  
Traditional methods require a larger team and more resources to create content and code from scratch.

### 6\. Iteration and Prototyping

AI game generators allow for rapid iteration and prototyping, enabling developers to test and refine ideas quickly.  
Traditional methods involve manual iteration and can be slower adapting to changes.

### 7\. Diverse Content Creation

AI game generators can produce various content variations, enhancing replayability and game diversity.  
Due to time and resource constraints, traditional methods may result in limited content.

### 8\. Human Expertise

AI game generators complement human expertise by automating routine tasks, freeing developers to focus on creative and strategic decisions.  
Traditional methods require developers to design, code, and implement every game element manually.

### 9\. Learning and Adaptation

AI game generators can learn from player behavior and adapt gameplay elements accordingly.  
Traditional methods rely on developers manually adjusting game elements based on feedback.

### 9\. Learning and Adaptation

AI game generators can learn from player behavior and adapt gameplay elements accordingly.  
Traditional methods rely on developers manually adjusting game elements based on feedback.

While AI game generators offer numerous advantages regarding efficiency, speed, and innovation, it's important to recognize that they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. They excel in automating certain tasks and enhancing creativity, but they are most effective when used with human expertise to create well-balanced and engaging gaming experiences.
