## Must-Read: Learn From Deepfake Scandals & Protect Your Stream

 Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) tools have significantly influenced various industries, including streaming services. In the recent wave of development,**deepfake streamers** have emerged as a way of replicating people in videos. Creators are also using**deepfake live streams** to engage viewers with avatars that look just like their favorite celebs. However, deepfake streams often encounter attacks and issues that may question their authenticity. In this article, we look at some of the hacks creators can use to beat deepfake attacks.

## Part 1: What is Deepfake Scandals?

 Deepfake scandals involve incidents when media is manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI) in unethical or harmful ways.

![deepface scandals](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/5-must-know-hacks-to-beat-deepfake-attacks-streamer-survival-guide-1.jpg)

Some of the issues included in the Deepfake scandals include:

1. **Misinformation and Disinformation:** Creation of misleading and false videos or audio recordings of public figures, which helps to sway public opinion and influence elections.
2. **Financial Fraud:** Impersonating someone to gain access to their financial accounts and other personal information.
3. **Nonconsensual Deepfake Pornography:** Superimposing an individual’s face or body onto another’s in sexually explicit content without their consent.
4. **Cyberbullying and harassment:** Creating humiliating or embarrassing videos of an individual to harass or cyberbully them.

## Part 2: Must-read Tips for Deepfake Streamers

 The rise of deepfake content has caught the eyes of many regulatory agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The major concern is the use of deepfakes for crimes like blackmail, extortion, and harassment. With several scandals also pegged to deepfake, streamers need to be conscious of how they use this technology. Here are 5 must-read pieces of advice concerning deepfakes.

### **1\.** **Choose Your Content Wisely**

 Although the power of deepfakes is undeniable, creatives can overcome it by choosing content wisely. To be on the safe side, avoid content that treads on sensitive ground. Stay away from topics that spread misinformation, and avoid engaging in malicious humor or issues that involve impersonating real people without their consent. You may be considering using fictional narratives, original characters, or transformative works that push the boundaries of storytelling. Try to be more creative and imaginative in your work while staying within the ethical frameworks.

### **2\.** **Be Transparent in Your Work**

 Streamers are often carried away by the buzz or the need to stay in the spotlight. However, being honest and transparent will help you stay authentic with your audience. Right from the onset, try to be as upfront with your views as possible about the use of deepfakes. By being open about your creative journey, you will be enhancing rather than spoiling the magic.

 The way you represent deepfakes to your audience means everything. Announce your personas clearly and explain the technology behind the creation. Use the opportunity to build trust with your audience and engage them in intriguing conversations about the nature of identity and digital representations. Doing so can also help spark more interest among the audience as they realize that they are interacting with a meticulously crafted avatar and not a celebrity clone.

### **3\.** **Label and Contextualize**

 When you are using deepfakes for streaming, treat your viewer like an intelligent companion. Avoid the mistake of seeing them as gullible marks. Make sure your content is clearly labeled as deepfake through titles, overlays, or disclaimers in your stream. Show that you care about your audience and you do not want to leave them guessing. Explain the purpose behind your chosen person and the creative choices that you have made.

### **4\.** **Prioritize Respect Over Reach**

 Deepfakes allow you to instantly explore fame and what people think of your avatar. However, avoid being carried away by the fame and being swayed to the unethical side. Steer clear of impersonation that can lead to reputational damage or harm vulnerable groups. Even if your avatar is just a fictional character, it still deserves ethical treatment. If it engaged in potential offensive behavior, make sure it is within the confines of your established narrative.

### **5\.** **Embrace the Collaborative Spirit**

 Deepfake streamlining has great potential for community building. You can easily collaborate with other creators by engaging in open discussions and encouraging responsible use of the technology. Working together with other creators also helps you to share knowledge and troubleshoot challenges together. You also get to elevate your content while contributing to a healthier and more responsible deepfake ecosystem.

 Creating amusing talking avatars with**Oddcast** **online** is an exciting endeavor that requires a blend of creativity and technical know-how. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

#### Step 1

 To start creating your funny talking avatar, you need to visit the [Oddcast TTS demo](https://www.oddcast.com/ttsdemo/index.php) page of**Oddcast Text to Speech** Tool. This is a free online tool that lets you create and download talking avatars in a few easy steps. You can access this page from any web browser on your computer or mobile device.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-1.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-1.jpg)

#### Step 2

 Once you are on the online demo page, you will see a list of characters on the left side of the page. These are the avatars that you can choose from to create your funny talking avatar. You can browse the characters by category, such as animals, celebrities, cartoons, etc. You can also search for a specific character by typing their name in the search box at the top of the list. For example, if you want to create a funny talking avatar of Donald Trump, you can type “Trump” in the search box and select his character from the list.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-2.jpg)

#### Step 3

 After you select a character, you will see their image on the right side of the page. This is where you can customize their appearance and voice settings. Below the character image, you will see an “Edit” button that allows you to change their hair, eyes, mouth, clothes, accessories, and background. You can click on this button and use the sliders and buttons to adjust these features as you like. For example, if you want to make your character look more funny, you can change their hair color, eye shape, mouth expression, etc.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-3.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-3.jpg)

#### Step 4

 Next to the “Edit” button, you will see two drop-down menus that allow you to choose a language and a voice for your character. You can select from over 25 languages and 200 voices that**Oddcast Text to Speech** Tool supports. You can also listen to a sample of each voice by clicking on the speaker icon next to the menu. For example, if you want to create a funny talking avatar of Donald Trump in Spanish, you can select “Spanish” from the language menu and “Jorge” from the voice menu.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-4.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-4.jpg)

#### Step 5

 Below the language and voice menus, you will see four sliders that allow you to adjust the pitch, speed, volume, and effects of your character’s voice. You can use these sliders to make your character sound more funny or realistic. For example, if you want to make your character sound more high-pitched or low-pitched, you can move the pitch slider to the left or right. If you want to make your character sound more fast or slow, you can move the speed slider to the left or right. If you want to make your character sound more loud or soft, you can move the volume slider to the left or right. If you want to add some effects to your character’s voice, such as echo or reverb, you can move the effects slider to the left or right.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-5.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-5.jpg)

#### Step 6

 Below the sliders, you will see a box where you can type or paste your text that you want your character to say aloud. You can use up to 1000 characters per request for this box. You can also use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags to add some pauses, emphasis, or other effects to your speech. SSML is a standard way of controlling how text is spoken by a speech synthesizer. You can use SSML tags by enclosing them in angle brackets (< >). For example, if you want to add a pause of half a second between two words, you can use the tag <break time=“500ms”/> between them. If you want to add some emphasis on a word or phrase, you can use the tag <emphasis> around them.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-6.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-6.jpg)

#### Step 7

 After you type or paste your text in the box, you can click on the “Say It” button below it to hear your character speak your text aloud. You will also see your character’s expressions and movements change according to your text. For example, if your text contains some punctuation marks or emoticons, such as ! ? :) :( etc., your character will show some corresponding emotions and gestures on their face and body.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-7.jpg)

#### Step 8

 To save or share your funny talking avatar, you can click on the “Download” or “Share” buttons below your character image. The **Oddcast voice** **“Download** ” button allows you to download your avatar as an**Oddcast text to speech** **mp3** audio file or a video file that contains both audio and visual elements of your avatar. The “Share” button allows you to share your avatar via email, Facebook, Twitter, or embed code that you can copy and paste on any website that supports HTML code.
