## Clone Your Voice: Harness the Potential of AI

One of the prominent applications of artificial intelligence is in the field of AI voice cloning. It eliminates bad-quality audio in a snap and replaces it with natural-sounding AI voices. Where production houses used to pay millions to voice actors, they can now use voice clones. This article will discuss the rise of voice cloning, its applications, and a relevant tool.

## Part 1: A Basic Definition of AI Voice Cloning

**AI voice cloning** refers to the techniques that enable users to generate deepfake voices from a sample. If you provide a sample that fulfills data requirements, AI will generate a voice you can customize. At the core, vast training datasets make the backbone of these tools.
