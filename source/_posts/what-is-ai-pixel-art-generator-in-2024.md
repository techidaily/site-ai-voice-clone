## Part 3\. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

 Making a****TikTok lip-sync** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

 You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

* **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

 Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

 Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

 While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

 Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

* **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

 Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

#### 6\. Microphone Integration for Voice-Driven AI

 Get your AI-powered avatar to speak in real time by connecting and speaking into the microphone. What you speak into the microphone is automatically replicated by the AI streamer during the event.

#### 7\. Interaction Through Text

 Trigger and get your AI streamer to speak based on your own written text. You only need to enter the text that you want and click Send. The AI streamer will then speech what you have typed.

#### 8\. Cloud-Based Operation

 Virbo Live offers you more freedom with the cloud-based operation. All the features are available online, and you do not have to struggle downloading any software. Operate directly from the cloud and freely manage your product.

## Conclusion

 TalkShopLive offers sellers and shoppers a unique experience to sell and buy products during live shows. The platform is specially designed to help in the distribution, collaboration, and sharing of a truly shoppable and social video experience.

 As a social-selling network, Talk Shop Live allows users to interact with each other and make informed purchase decisions. However, hiring a human streamer and preparing their content can be time-consuming and expensive. That’s why we recommend [Virbo Live](https://virbo.wondershare.com/virbo-live.html) as the future of live-stream shopping. Get access to AI-powered avatars that will keep your viewers engaged while boosting your revenue from live-stream events.
