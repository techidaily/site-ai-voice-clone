### History of China Livestream Shopping

 The start of promoting and selling products through live video occurred in China in 2016\. The giant social platform “[Taobao](https://www.yololiv.com/blog/the-history-and-future-of-live-shopping/) " introduced the concept of live-streaming e-commerce. This trend came to the attention of millions of Chinese consumers. Also, it appeared to be a convenient way, as everyone got smartphones and payment cards for easy procession.

 Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic proved to favor this shopping trend. This was because the physical market was almost shut down completely. Thus, China's live shopping took growth progress to approximately $352 billion by 2021\. Yet, there reached a point when it slowed down and devalued. Here are some of the critical reasons for the brief downfall of livestream shopping in China:

1. **Saturated Market:** The market became overcrowded with the gradual increase in livestream shopping. The increased competition among hosts led to its saturation and the pause in its growth.
2. **Consumer Fatigue:** Continuous exposure to livestream shopping events made consumers less enthusiastic. Also, regular promotional messages and a lack of variety made them lose interest.
3. **Scandals:** Mismanagement of live stream events and fraudulent practices hurt audiences' trust. It made this shopping method less reliable and trustworthy in viewers' eyes.
4. **Decreasing Innovation:Live stream shopping in China** gained sudden popularity. Yet, it no longer remained unique when more competition entered the market. It led to a decline in the excitement and engagement of consumers.

### Rise of China Live Shopping With Advancement in Technology

They released an in-app shopping feature in the “[WeChat](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/china-tech-giant-tencent-launches-new-online-shopping-feature-in-wechat-app.html) ” messaging service.
