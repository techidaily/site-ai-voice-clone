* Low consumer engagement rates with low-quality videos
* You will still need a creative team with resources to represent your brand well
* Amazon Live is still a fledging service and does not offer influencer marketing nor have its own place on Amazon’s website navigation yet

## Part 2: Step Guidance: Getting Started with Amazon Live

 To create a livestream on Amazon, you need to be a U.S. Professional Seller either registered as a U.S. Vendor or in the Amazon Brand Registry. Sellers who meet the requirements can create their livestreams through the[Amazon Live Creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) mobile app.

![amazon live creator app](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-2.jpg)

 With Amazon streaming live service, you can record Livestream in advance and schedule them to go up at a later date or go Live in real-time. This will usually depend on your goals and the kind of interaction you want with your audience. In any case, Amazon recommends the use of an external camera and a video encounter instead of your mobile phone to ensure quality video. Although you can use either, an external camera gives you an edge in terms of quality. Let’s have a look at a detailed step-by-step guide to getting started with Amazon Live:

##### Step 1 Create an Amazon Live Account

 Download the[Amazon Live Creator app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) from the Apps Store. The app is currently only available for iOS and will work on iPhone or iPad. Sign into your Seller, Influencer, or Vendor account and create a Live Account.

##### Step 2 Enter Details of your Product or Brand

 Choose your brand and enter the desired profile name. Edit your profile the way you like to be a true representation of your brand.

##### Step 3 Add Products to Your Livestream

 Choose the products you want to add to your livestream. These are the products that you want to promote and use to engage with your viewers.

##### Step 4 Set Up Your Amazon Livestream

 With the product added, you are ready to set up your live stream. Take some time in the practice mode to familiarize yourself with the platform, and prepare your talking points. Also, come up with responses to possible customer questions and any other important information. Although Amazon Live is free, you can also consider using Amazon advertising to reach a wider audience.

##### Step 5 Go Live

 Once everything is ready, enter your stream time and start time. You can view your analytics from the homepage and see how well the live stream is performing.

 Once published, Amazon Live events can be found on the[Amazon.com/Live page](https://www.amazon.com/live) . They are also discoverable in Amazon stores, product detail pages, and the Amazon mobile app under “Amazon Live.” A well-presented Amazon Live stream will:

* Build a community by communicating and engaging with consumers
* Entice viewers to take action
* Reduce pre-purchase support requests, such as live chat
* Generate sales
* Lower returns by providing essential details and answers
