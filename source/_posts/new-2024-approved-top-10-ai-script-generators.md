## What Is an AI Avatar? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. What exactly is an AI avatar?

AI avatar refers to a digital representation or embodiment of an individual that is created and controlled using artificial intelligence techniques. It is an interactive virtual character that can simulate human-like behaviors, emotions, and interactions.

AI avatars are often designed to resemble human appearance and can be used in various applications, such as virtual assistants, customer service representatives, virtual companions, or virtual reality environments.

AI algorithms and technologies, including natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning power these avatars.
