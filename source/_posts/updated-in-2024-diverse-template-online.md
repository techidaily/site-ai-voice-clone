#### Alibaba International

###### Operational Steps

* **Prepare Equipment, Network, and Browser**
* **Install Virtual Sound Card**  
  * Due to audio restrictions on Alibaba International, a virtual sound card is required. If your computer's sound device has a "stereo mix," it can be used as an alternative. Check the path: My Computer - Properties - Sound - Sound Control Panel - Recording.
* **Set Up "Stereo Mix"**  
  * Skip this step if using a virtual sound card.  
  * Click My Computer - Properties - Sound - Sound Control Panel - Recording, activate stereo sound effects, and set it as default.  
  * Click Properties - Listen, select your speaker device, and click OK.  
  * Confirm the settings by playing a video on your computer. If both speakers and the microphone show sound detection, the setup is successful.
* **Download and Install OBS**  
  * As Alibaba International has restrictions on webcams, OBS is needed as a virtual camera (future Virbo Live product features will support this).  
  * After installation, go to Settings - Video and change the resolution to "1080x1920." Select the "+" sign - Window Capture, and add the window of the Live Explosion (Live Version).  
  * Crop the URL bar by holding Ctrl + left-click. Click "Start Virtual Camera."
* **Prepare Materials**
* **Initiate the Live Stream**
* **Start Live Streaming on Alibaba Seller's Live Companion**  
  * Log in to Alibaba Seller, open the live stream, and the Alibaba Live Companion window will pop up.  
  * Choose "Free Mode," add the camera, select Logitech c930e, and display it to cover the entire screen.  
  * Set the microphone to stereo mix or virtual sound card, click OK, and confirm the microphone has fluctuations.  
  * After adding products, click "Start Live" or "Start Reception."
