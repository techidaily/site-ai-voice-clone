6. **Legal and Ethical Boundaries:**  Upholding legal and ethical boundaries is important in all documents. If the video contains any medical records, it is essential to keep them confidential. In case of sensitive information, a translator must follow legal and ethical considerations.
7. **Requirements and Review:**  To achieve perfection, try finding a native translator for proofreading. The translator should follow any specific instructions provided by the client.

 You can drag and drop a video on this window or just link your video the old-school way.

Step 3 \- Select your original (source) and translated languages

 Next, you have to select your languages. If you are translating from Hindi to English, select Hindi as the original language and English as the Translated language, as you can see in the screenshot below.

Step 4 \- Translate your video

 Finally, hit the orange “Translate this video” button at the bottom. You can also select some other options like lip sync and subtitles (for direct download).

 That’s all you need to do. Leave the rest to Virbo. Virbo will take some time, depending on the length, to translate the entire video and present your translation.
