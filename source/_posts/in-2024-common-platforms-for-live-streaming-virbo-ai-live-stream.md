* **Download and Install OBS**  
  * As Alibaba International has restrictions on webcams, OBS is needed as a virtual camera (future Virbo Live product features will support this).  
  * After installation, go to Settings - Video and change the resolution to "1080x1920." Select the "+" sign - Window Capture, and add the window of the Live Explosion (Live Version).
