 To change the language of your TikTok, perform the following instructions:

1. Tap the “Three Lines” from the top right corner of the Profile screen and proceed with the “Settings and Privacy” option.
2. Next, you will have to locate the “App Language” option and choose your preferred language for your TikTok app.

## **Conclusion**
