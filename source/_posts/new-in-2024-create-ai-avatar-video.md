## Part 1\. The Basic Concept of Livestream Shopping: What It Is?

 Livestream shopping is a practice that involves product promotion through a live video. This innovative concept creates an engaging environment for shopping through live video entertainment. Unlike traditional e-commerce, livestream shopping encourages active audience participation. As a result, viewers can get real-time product demonstrations and responses from the hosts.

 Now that you know the concept of**livestream shopping in China** , let's head to its requirements. You don't need any physical platform as it operates completely online. Navigate through this section to learn about the requirements for successful livestream shopping:

### 1\. Video Equipment

 You need a fine camera to ensure clear video for high-quality product display. Also, there should be a tripod stand to keep this camera stable and cover multiple angles. You may also use ring lights or LED panels, as good lighting is crucial for better visibility.

### 2\. Audio Equipment

 Make sure to use an external microphone, as a dedicated one ensures better audio quality. Also, a hands-free microphone makes operability easier for hosts moving around in the live stream.

### 3\. Live Streaming Setup

 You must have a computer to handle streaming software and many applications. Use any of the streaming software, but make sure to have a strong internet connection. You also need a platform that supports live-stream shopping, like Facebook or TikTok.

### 4\. Monitoring and Analytics Tools

 You need multiple-screen monitors to keep an eye on the live stream, chat, and any content. Plus, make use of an analytics tool to track viewer engagement and other relevant metrics. Considering all these factors, it is clear that you do not require a physical brand store to run a live campaign. Anyone can conduct live selling China sessions with products.

## Part 2\. China Live Shopping: Is It Booming or Devaluing?

 Livestream shopping took an exciting turn in its success and productivity. It didn't just happen to grow on its own; there's a whole course of action and history behind it. To make your understanding clearer, read this brief history of**China's live shopping** :

### History of China Livestream Shopping

 The start of promoting and selling products through live video occurred in China in 2016\. The giant social platform “[Taobao](https://www.yololiv.com/blog/the-history-and-future-of-live-shopping/) " introduced the concept of live-streaming e-commerce. This trend came to the attention of millions of Chinese consumers. Also, it appeared to be a convenient way, as everyone got smartphones and payment cards for easy procession.

 Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic proved to favor this shopping trend. This was because the physical market was almost shut down completely. Thus, China's live shopping took growth progress to approximately $352 billion by 2021\. Yet, there reached a point when it slowed down and devalued. Here are some of the critical reasons for the brief downfall of livestream shopping in China:

1. **Saturated Market:** The market became overcrowded with the gradual increase in livestream shopping. The increased competition among hosts led to its saturation and the pause in its growth.
2. **Consumer Fatigue:** Continuous exposure to livestream shopping events made consumers less enthusiastic. Also, regular promotional messages and a lack of variety made them lose interest.
3. **Scandals:** Mismanagement of live stream events and fraudulent practices hurt audiences' trust. It made this shopping method less reliable and trustworthy in viewers' eyes.
4. **Decreasing Innovation:Live stream shopping in China** gained sudden popularity. Yet, it no longer remained unique when more competition entered the market. It led to a decline in the excitement and engagement of consumers.

### Rise of China Live Shopping With Advancement in Technology

 As we discussed the downfall of**live-streaming shopping in China** , there is another point to ponder. The lack of technology was the main factor for all those reasons for downfall. With the advancement of AI and virtual avatars, it has again taken the pace of growth. These new technological systems are offering more versatility and security in livestream shopping.

 According to[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1301256/china-number-of-live-commerce-users/) , there is a gradual increase in livestream shoppers in China. This increase can be seen in the comparison chart pasted below:

![reviewing statistical improvement china live shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/china-live-shopping-industry-dynamics-2.jpg)

 A Chinese tech giant “Tencent” adapted to the challenges of this shopping trend. They released an in-app shopping feature in the “[WeChat](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/china-tech-giant-tencent-launches-new-online-shopping-feature-in-wechat-app.html) ” messaging service. It led to a gross profit of almost $14 billion in the overall valuation. Moreover, several tools are now working in favor of livestream shopping, increasing users' diversity. Provided are three essential types of tools serving in this industry:

#### 1\. Social Platforms

 Some trending social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok represent different marketing features. The audience is already there, so you just need to go live to catch their attention.

#### 2\. Production Tools

 These tools can improve your production experience, leading to better conversion rates. Some even let you stream across multiple platforms and get comments.

#### 3\. E-commerce Tools

 The focus of this type of tool, like Shopify, is on the buying and delivering process. They handle things like bundling, discounts, cart management, and more. Their assistive role in developing live shopping systems is evident across the market.
