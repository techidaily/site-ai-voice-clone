Here are the steps to turn on closed captions videos on Twitter:

* **Step 1.** Open the Twitter app or website and find the video tweet that you want to watch with closed captions. This tweet could be in your timeline or a user's profile.
* **Step 2.** Tap the video's thumbnail to play the video.
* **Step 3.** Tap on the three dots at the top right of the screen to bring up the video player controls.

![Twitter’s video playback](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-2.jpeg)

* **Step 3.** Tag the Bot Account

 When you find a video tweet you want to translate, reply to that tweet and tag the translation bot account. You can mention the bot account's username and request a translation.

* **Step 4.** Wait for Translation

 The translation bot account will automatically respond to your tweet with the translated text. Depending on the bot's processing time and availability, this may take a few moments.

* **Step 5.** Review the Translations

 Once you receive the translation, review it to ensure accuracy and readability. Remember that automated translations may not always be perfect. So, use your judgment to assess the quality of the translation.

## Part 1\. How AI Subtitle Translators Work

**AI subtitle translators** generally use ASR and Machine Learning technologies to carry out the task. Automatic speech recognition technology converts spoken audio into text. The developers train these systems on vast amounts of audio data for text identification. Once the speech is transcribed, AI translation engines convert the text into the target language. Here is the complete breakdown of how these subtitle translators work:

1. **Input:** You provide the video or subtitle file containing the source language. For this, some translators allow you to paste the URL of videos. However, some require you to import the whole video or SRT file.
2. **Speech Recognition:** The AI system extracts the audio and converts it into text. In the case of only subtitle files, the systems will recognize the language of the uploaded SRT.
3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.

AI game generators can learn from player behavior and adapt gameplay elements accordingly.  
Traditional methods rely on developers manually adjusting game elements based on feedback.

While AI game generators offer numerous advantages regarding efficiency, speed, and innovation, it's important to recognize that they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. They excel in automating certain tasks and enhancing creativity, but they are most effective when used with human expertise to create well-balanced and engaging gaming experiences.
