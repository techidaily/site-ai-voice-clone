## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

 Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

 An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can't afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.

### 4. **3D animation**

 If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you'll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg)

 Consider 3D animation if you're a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.

![animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg)

#### **Introduction:**

In the realm of digital artistry, the fusion of artificial intelligence and visual aesthetics has given rise to innovative tools that redefine creativity. One such remarkable advancement is the AI pixel art generator. By merging the precision of AI algorithms with the nostalgic charm of pixel art, this technology opens up new horizons for artists, designers, and enthusiasts alike.

#### **What Is Pixel Art?**

Pixel art is a form of digital art that harks back to the early days of computing. It employs deliberate low-resolution design, using small, individual blocks or pixels to craft intricate images. Each pixel is meticulously chosen to create detailed visuals, often evoking a sense of nostalgia and simplicity.

#### **What Is AI Pixel Art Generator?**

The AI pixel art generator is a cutting-edge tool that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to automate the creation of pixel art. By analyzing patterns, color schemes, and artistic styles present in existing pixel art or reference images, these generators can produce stunning pixel art pieces with impressive accuracy and efficiency.

#### **The Main Purpose of Pixel Art Generator:**

The primary goal of a pixel art generator is to simplify the often labor-intensive process of creating pixel art. Traditional pixel art demands painstaking attention to detail, pixel by pixel. AI pixel art generators alleviate this burden by swiftly generating complex designs while retaining the charm and uniqueness of handcrafted pixel art.

#### **What Is AI Pixel Art Generator Used For?**

1. **Gaming Industry:** AI pixel art generators are widely employed in game development to create character sprites, environment assets, and animations. They enable game developers to efficiently generate pixel art content that aligns with the desired aesthetic.
2. **Graphic Design:** Graphic designers use AI pixel art generators to swiftly generate pixel-based logos, icons, and illustrations. This streamlines the design process and maintains a consistent pixelated style.
3. **Art and Animation:** Artists leverage AI pixel art generators to experiment with new styles, generate base artwork, or as a reference for manual creations. It serves as a valuable tool for both novice and seasoned artists.

#### **Types of Pixel Art Generators:**

1. **Style Imitation:** These generators analyze existing pixel art to replicate a particular artistic style in new creations.
2. **Upscaling:** Some AI generators enhance the resolution of low-res images, adding detail to pixel art without sacrificing its original essence.
3. **Pattern Recognition:** These generators identify recurring patterns and structures in pixel art, assisting in the creation of intricate designs.

#### **List of Best AI Pixel Art Generators:**

1. **DALL-E Pixel:** Inspired by OpenAI's DALL-E, this generator creates pixel art from text prompts, merging textual creativity with visual representation.
2. **Pixela:** Known for its user-friendly interface, Pixela uses AI to transform reference images into pixel art masterpieces.
3. **Pixelmash:** A versatile tool offering features like dynamic lighting effects and animation capabilities, enabling the creation of advanced pixel art.
4. **DeepArt.io:** Although primarily focused on general art styles, DeepArt.io can also produce pixel art pieces using its AI algorithms.
5. **Pix2Pix:** While originally designed for image-to-image translation, Pix2Pix can also generate pixel art by converting rough sketches into polished designs.

#### **Conclusion:**

The emergence of AI pixel art generators exemplifies the harmonious fusion of human creativity and technological prowess. By streamlining the creation process and unlocking new possibilities in digital design, these tools stand as a testament to the boundless potential of AI in the creative realm. As the technology evolves, we can only anticipate even more breathtaking and unique pixel art creations that blur the line between human ingenuity and artificial intelligence.
