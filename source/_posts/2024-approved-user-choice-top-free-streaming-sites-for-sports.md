## What Is an AI Art Generator?

## Part 1\. What is an AI art generator?

An AI art generator is a software or system that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to create or assist in creating art. It uses machine learning algorithms, and intense learning models, to analyze and understand various artistic styles, designs, and patterns.

Creators are also using**deepfake live streams** to engage viewers with avatars that look just like their favorite celebs. However, deepfake streams often encounter attacks and issues that may question their authenticity. In this article, we look at some of the hacks creators can use to beat deepfake attacks.

![deepface scandals](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/5-must-know-hacks-to-beat-deepfake-attacks-streamer-survival-guide-1.jpg)

Some of the issues included in the Deepfake scandals include:

1. **Misinformation and Disinformation:** Creation of misleading and false videos or audio recordings of public figures, which helps to sway public opinion and influence elections.
2. **Financial Fraud:** Impersonating someone to gain access to their financial accounts and other personal information.
3. **Nonconsensual Deepfake Pornography:** Superimposing an individual’s face or body onto another’s in sexually explicit content without their consent.
4. **Cyberbullying and harassment:** Creating humiliating or embarrassing videos of an individual to harass or cyberbully them.

## Part 2: Must-read Tips for Deepfake Streamers

 The rise of deepfake content has caught the eyes of many regulatory agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The major concern is the use of deepfakes for crimes like blackmail, extortion, and harassment. With several scandals also pegged to deepfake, streamers need to be conscious of how they use this technology. Here are 5 must-read pieces of advice concerning deepfakes.

### **1\.** **Choose Your Content Wisely**

 Although the power of deepfakes is undeniable, creatives can overcome it by choosing content wisely. To be on the safe side, avoid content that treads on sensitive ground. Stay away from topics that spread misinformation, and avoid engaging in malicious humor or issues that involve impersonating real people without their consent. You may be considering using fictional narratives, original characters, or transformative works that push the boundaries of storytelling. Try to be more creative and imaginative in your work while staying within the ethical frameworks.

### **2\.** **Be Transparent in Your Work**

 Streamers are often carried away by the buzz or the need to stay in the spotlight. However, being honest and transparent will help you stay authentic with your audience. Right from the onset, try to be as upfront with your views as possible about the use of deepfakes. By being open about your creative journey, you will be enhancing rather than spoiling the magic.

 The way you represent deepfakes to your audience means everything. Announce your personas clearly and explain the technology behind the creation. Use the opportunity to build trust with your audience and engage them in intriguing conversations about the nature of identity and digital representations. Doing so can also help spark more interest among the audience as they realize that they are interacting with a meticulously crafted avatar and not a celebrity clone.

### **3\.** **Label and Contextualize**

 When you are using deepfakes for streaming, treat your viewer like an intelligent companion. Avoid the mistake of seeing them as gullible marks. Make sure your content is clearly labeled as deepfake through titles, overlays, or disclaimers in your stream. Show that you care about your audience and you do not want to leave them guessing. Explain the purpose behind your chosen person and the creative choices that you have made.

### **4\.** **Prioritize Respect Over Reach**

 Deepfakes allow you to instantly explore fame and what people think of your avatar. However, avoid being carried away by the fame and being swayed to the unethical side. Steer clear of impersonation that can lead to reputational damage or harm vulnerable groups. Even if your avatar is just a fictional character, it still deserves ethical treatment. If it engaged in potential offensive behavior, make sure it is within the confines of your established narrative.

### **5\.** **Embrace the Collaborative Spirit**

 Deepfake streamlining has great potential for community building. You can easily collaborate with other creators by engaging in open discussions and encouraging responsible use of the technology. Working together with other creators also helps you to share knowledge and troubleshoot challenges together. You also get to elevate your content while contributing to a healthier and more responsible deepfake ecosystem.
