## Part 2: Why is B2B Video Marketing Important?

**B2B video marketing** is essential to reach your targeted businesses easily. This section will highlight the significance of B2B video marketing in a brief manner.

### 1\. Visually Appealing and Engaging

**B2B YouTube** videos are naturally appealing due to their captivating visuals. That’s why B2B video marketing can effectively catch the attention of your targeted audience. You can add animation and use Avatars to add distinctiveness to your video. Moreover, you can embed your**B2B video** with an engaging audio track to make your audience attentive.

## 2024  Easy Steps to Translate Video on Twitter

 Do you want people around the world to watch your videos on Twitter? What about those who might want to watch but don't speak your language? Without video translation, you're missing out on reaching many potential viewers.****Translating Twitter videos** lets you connect with audiences from different cultures and languages.

 Translated videos also lead to better engagement. Viewers are more likely to watch accurately translated videos on Twitter. If your video has a bad translation, you could lose viewers. Translations help more people to understand your content. That way, they will have a chance to share your video. This leads to higher engagement with viewers worldwide.

 If you have videos that need translating, we're here to help and guide you through the process.

![translate-twitter-video-1.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-1.jpg)

## **Part 1\. Why Translate Twitter Video?**

 Twitter has a vast user base worldwide. It offers an unparalleled opportunity to connect with diverse audiences. But the language barrier often stands as a significant obstacle.****Translating Twitter videos** addresses this challenge head-on. By offering many benefits beyond mere language comprehension.

Here's some benefit of translating video:

* **Accessibility to diverse audiences**

 When you translate videos on Twitter, you're breaking down language barriers. So everyone, no matter their language, can understand your content. This means more people connect with you, opening to diverse communities worldwide.

* **Increased reach and engagement**

 Translating videos helps you reach more people on Twitter. If your content speaks different languages, more viewers can engage with it. Making your message go further and have more impact.

* **Building a more inclusive online community**

 By translating your videos, you're making Twitter a more welcoming place for everyone. Regardless of their language. This builds a stronger community where diverse voices are valued and heard.

## **Part 2\. Are There Built-in Translation Features on Twitter for Video?**

 Twitter has limited features in terms of translation. Currently, Twitter only allows the translation of text within tweets. There are no built-in features for translating video content directly on the platform. But, you can enable closed captions to aid in understanding video content.

Here are the steps to turn on closed captions videos on Twitter:

* **Step 1.** Open the Twitter app or website and find the video tweet that you want to watch with closed captions. This tweet could be in your timeline or a user's profile.
* **Step 2.** Tap the video's thumbnail to play the video.
* **Step 3.** Tap on the three dots at the top right of the screen to bring up the video player controls.

![Twitter’s video playback](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-2.jpeg)

* **Step 4.** Look for the closed captions (CC) icon on the video player controls. It usually appears as a small icon with the letters "Captions" or "CC" inside a rectangle. Tap on this icon to turn on closed captions.

![Turn on Captions](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-twitter-video-3.jpeg)

* **Step 5.** Once closed captions are enabled, watch the video as usual. You should see text at the bottom of the screen that provides a written transcription of the audio content.

 However, closed captions on Twitter are not perfect. Not every video on Twitter shows this feature. That's why this feature is not a popular option for many users.

## **Part 3\. How to Translate Twitter Video With Twitter Translator Bots**

 Users must use external tools such as bot accounts and AI video translators to translate videos on Twitter. These tools can help translate video content on Twitter. Making it more accessible to diverse audiences. While****Twitter video translation** features are limited, alternative methods can overcome these language barriers.

Using bot accounts on Twitter to translate videos involves a few steps:

* **Step 1.** Find a Translation Bot Account

 Look for bot accounts on Twitter specifically designed for translation purposes. Some of them are @TranslateMom, @Translatevidapp, and @vidtranslator. These accounts are programmed to translate video to text-based content automatically.

* **Step 2.** Follow the Bot Account

 Once you've found a suitable translation bot account, they usually require you to follow them to receive the translations.

* **Step 3.** Tag the Bot Account

 When you find a video tweet you want to translate, reply to that tweet and tag the translation bot account. You can mention the bot account's username and request a translation.

* **Step 4.** Wait for Translation

 The translation bot account will automatically respond to your tweet with the translated text. Depending on the bot's processing time and availability, this may take a few moments.

* **Step 5.** Review the Translations

 Once you receive the translation, review it to ensure accuracy and readability. Remember that automated translations may not always be perfect. So, use your judgment to assess the quality of the translation.

S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of**live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

 To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

 Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration** : Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.
