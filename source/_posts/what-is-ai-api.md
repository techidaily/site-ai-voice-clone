1. **Precision and Uniformity:**  There are no grammatical or factual errors in the translation. The tool must maintain the context and essence of the content. The translation should be natural while avoiding any awkward encounters. Moreover, the tone and writing style should be consistent throughout the document.
2. **Cultural Boundaries:**  The tone or words must not violate cultural norms and ethics. Some cultures are sensitive to specific content, while to some, it is no big deal. Hence, the translator should have background information on target cultures.

7. **Requirements and Review:**  To achieve perfection, try finding a native translator for proofreading. The translator should follow any specific instructions provided by the client. This covers word count, file format, or reference materials. Besides, deadlines should be followed in handling translation to clients. Through the process, the translator must uphold communication with the client.
