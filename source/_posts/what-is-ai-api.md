Major tech companies and AI platforms offer AI APIs, allowing developers to tap into powerful AI services and integrate them seamlessly into their projects.

## **Part 2\. How can AI revolutionize the API?**

Introducing AI can bring several changes and enhancements to APIs, revolutionizing the way applications interact with users and handle complex data. With the integration of AI-powered capabilities, APIs can evolve from simple data processors to intelligent agents capable of understanding and adapting to user needs. These enhancements empower developers to create applications that offer users more personalized and engaging experiences.

One of the significant advantages of AI-powered APIs is the ability to add natural language interfaces, allowing users to interact with applications using spoken or written language. This shift towards more intuitive interactions eliminates the need for complex user interfaces, making applications more accessible and user-friendly for a broader audience.

Moreover, AI can provide predictive analytics, enabling APIs to forecast future trends and patterns based on historical data. This valuable feature equips businesses with data-driven insights, facilitating better decision-making and strategic planning.

The introduction of AI also leads to automation within APIs, streamlining various processes and reducing the manual effort required. This automation enhances efficiency, saving time and resources while ensuring consistent and reliable results.

Security is another crucial aspect that benefits from AI integration. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, AI-powered APIs can continuously monitor and detect potential threats, ensuring a proactive approach to cybersecurity. This advanced security layer protects sensitive data and mitigates risks, fostering trust between users and applications.

Furthermore, AI enhances APIs with contextual understanding, allowing them to analyze user interactions and preferences in real-time. Armed with this knowledge, APIs can deliver highly relevant and personalized recommendations, increasing user engagement and satisfaction.

In summary, AI-infused APIs open up a world of possibilities, bringing advanced capabilities such as personalization, automation, predictive analytics, natural language processing, and improved security. As technology advances, AI integration will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the future of application development, driving innovation, and delivering exceptional user experiences. challenges they may present.

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

 Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

 To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

 The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.
