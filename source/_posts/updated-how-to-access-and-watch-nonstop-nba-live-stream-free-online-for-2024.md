##### Step 2 Choose AI Streamers and Background

##### Step 3 Enter Text or Voice

 With the avatar set, you need to upload your audio or enter a script with all the necessary details. Virbo Live allows you to automate this step with the AI smart scriptwriter and AI translator. Simply enter basic details about your product, and the Smart AI Scriptwriter will generate a fully detailed script for the avatar. Be sure to specify the language that you want to use and the desired tone for a more accurate script.
