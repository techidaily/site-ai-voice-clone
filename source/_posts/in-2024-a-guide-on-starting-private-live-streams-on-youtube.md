## Part 1: What is TalkShopLive?

[TalkShopLive](https://talkshop.live/) is a social-selling network for home shopping and live streaming shows. It comes with a built-in buying experience for all kinds of shoppers. With Talk Shop Live, anyone can sell and buy products from anywhere through interactive video shows. You can think of ShopTalk Live as a combination of HSN, QVC, and social media tolled into one.

![talk shop live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/is-talkshoplive-right-for-you-live-shop-pros-tips-before-you-start-1.jpg)

 The TalkShopLive studio app for brands and creators brings an array of broadcast and management tools to mobile. The platform boasts of enabling users to promote and sell their shows before and after going live. This means that you can create a shoppable and shareable video for promoting your show even before it goes live. Technically, you do not have to worry about the aftermath since your content will remain shoppable after the live streaming event comes to an end.

 You also get to do a whole range of other cool things with Talk Shop Live. With this studio app, you can virtually collaborate with four people in a live stream, simulcast on Facebook, pin comments, and more.
