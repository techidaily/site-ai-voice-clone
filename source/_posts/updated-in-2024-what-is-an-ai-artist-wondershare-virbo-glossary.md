## What Is an AI Artist? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## **Part 1\. What is an AI artist?**

AI artist refers to an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to create art autonomously or assist human artists in their creative process. AI artists use machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to analyze and understand patterns in existing artworks and generate new art based on that knowledge.

Some AI artists can create paintings, drawings, or digital art, while others can generate music, poetry, or video content. They work by learning from a vast dataset of existing artworks or creative content and then producing original pieces that mimic the style, themes, or elements present in those examples.

AI artists are not meant to replace human creativity but rather to augment it and inspire new ideas. They can be valuable tools for artists to experiment with different styles, generate concepts, or overcome creative blocks. AI art is continually evolving, and the creations of AI artists often spark discussions about the intersection of technology and creativity in the art world.

## **Part 2\. Guidelines for responsible use of AI artists**

When utilizing AI artists, it is essential to consider the following factors:

#### 1\. Data and Copyright

Ensure that the AI artist's training data and the generated content do not violate copyright or intellectual property rights. Make sure to use properly licensed datasets and obtain permission when using copyrighted materials as inputs.

#### 2\. Bias and Fairness

AI artists learn from existing data, and if the data contains biases, it may reflect in the generated content. Be cautious of any biases present in the training data and take steps to mitigate or address them to ensure fairness and inclusivity in the generated art.

#### 3\. Creative Input

While AI artists can be helpful tools, it's essential to maintain the artist's creative input and not rely solely on AI-generated content. AI should be seen as a collaborator or a source of inspiration rather than a substitute for human creativity.

#### 4\. Experimentation and Exploration

Use AI artists to explore new artistic styles, techniques, and ideas. Embrace the experimental nature of AI-generated art and push the boundaries of creativity with technology.

#### 5\. Ethical Use

Be mindful of the content generated by AI artists and ensure that it aligns with ethical standards and societal norms. Avoid using AI to create harmful or offensive content.

#### 6\. Authenticity and Attribution

If AI-generated art is used in public or commercial contexts, clearly attribute the contribution of the AI artist and respect the transparency in disclosing the involvement of AI in the creative process.

#### 7\. Technical Limitations

Understand the limitations of the AI artist's capabilities and know that it may not always produce perfect or refined results. It's important to consider the context and appropriateness of the generated content.

#### 8\. User Privacy

If the AI artist interacts with users or requires user data, ensure user privacy is protected and data handling complies with relevant regulations and best practices.

#### 9\. Continual Improvement

Keep track of advancements in AI art and regularly update the AI artist's models to benefit from the latest technological developments and improvements.

By paying attention to these considerations, users can make the most of AI artists while maintaining ethical, creative, and responsible use of the technology.

## How to Make Animated Explainer Videos

 Explainer films are among the easiest and most inventive methods to present a project, a product, a service, or pretty much anything else you can imagine. In reality, the demand for an explanation film increases with product complexity. Fortunately, with the help of some of the fantastic explainer video software tools available online, you may be able to accomplish it yourself.

![animated-explainer-video.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-video.jpg)

 You'll find a few tools in this article that will let you sit down and make whatever kind of explainer film you want. An overview of the key components required for a successful explainer video is provided at the bottom.

## **Part 1: The Preparation Stage of Animated Explainers**

 An explainer video's primary goal is to improve the company's marketing plan. They are so distinctive and ultimately successful because of this. However, for the creation process to be successful, it must also include all participants and be open and transparent. The process may sometimes be full of intriguing and surprising answers at any point, or it might reach a dead end. Actually, the whole creative process is quite orderly and transparent. Here is a list of the actions you need to do to complete it successfully.

### **Define Your Target Audience and Purpose:**

 The process often begins with project research, which includes gathering data from the customer, doing a market study, and completing product research.

 The key is clarity since it will enable you to precisely explain your requirements for team members and resources. Your explainer video's success depends on careful preparation. You must work together without hurrying or falling behind since there will be several connected jobs.

### **Craft a Compelling Script:**

 The screenplay describes all the video's spoken words, whether you're using voiceovers, dialogue, or a mix of the two. During the pre-production phase, we devote a significant amount of time and effort to scriptwriting.

 Consequently, the next and most crucial phase in the creation of animated videos is scriptwriting. It determines if a marketing message will be conveyed to the target audience clearly and, more broadly, whether the video will convert.

### **Select the Right Animation Style and Tools:**

 After the script has been polished and completed, style and formatting are needed. This phase also aids in giving you a general idea of the character that will appear in the video, the color schemes that will be used, the tone, etc. Start by gathering supporting materials for the final film, such as images, videos, and other elements. Referencing your storyboard and keeping a list of the materials your video needs is a smart idea. Animated characters, icons, and images are examples of assets.

 Make the spectator feel as if they are a part of the universe you have created. This is a challenging step since you must coordinate all the animations to get the ideal outcome! Along with speech and other significant notes, they often contain instructions for camera angles, tips and changes for lighting, and transitions between scenes.

### **Choose an Appropriate Voice-Over or Narration:**

 Like the majority of experienced writers, brilliant marketers start their videos with voice-over narrations. It's crucial to remember that before the animation process can begin, the voice-over must be recorded.

 The majority of video editing programs provide you access to stock music that you may use in your productions. As an alternative, you may search through a variety of websites with royalty-free music to locate the ideal song for your film.

## **Part 2: The Operation Procedure to Create Animated Explainer Videos**

 Some people may believe that making animated explanation films is simple. The misunderstanding is mostly caused by how brief and uncomplicated many animated videos on social media are. From consulting with customers, selecting ideas, and developing a storyboard to accomplishing business objectives, video production is complicated.

### **Design Captivating Characters or Visual Elements** **:**

 For many years, the customer journey has been heavily influenced by brand identification and brand trust. Finding a simple technique to easily convey your brand to a target demographic is the difficult part. Animated explainer videos excel in this situation. A useful tool for promoting goods, services, concepts, and companies is an animated explainer film. Explainer videos are an innovative marketing strategy that many forward-thinking companies actively include into their operations.

 There are several techniques to animate your films since there is no one approach that works perfectly. Be original and imaginative. You could be unsure about what style to utilize as a result. You should create many instances of the same character because of this. It aids in better appreciating the mood of the video. In this manner, you can choose which fashions suit your brand and the tone of the film the most!

### **Animate the Scenes Using Motion Graphics or Traditional Animation Techniques:**

 The second piece of advice is to make sure your animated film appears just as stunning without sound as it does with it. An animated figure often follows a script in an explainer film, utilizing objects and other visual elements to guide viewers through a process or explain a topic. When developing mascots for a family-oriented product offering, live-action videos may have a significant influence.

 The most enjoyable part is undoubtedly the illustrations! You get to choose and create your characters' environments. Users will be interested and more inclined to watch the video due to the animation. Because of this, it's preferable to employ titers in the film or make your animation seem catchy from the very beginning.

### **Incorporate Suitable Background Music and Sound Effects:**

 The audience won't be interested in the product if the voice-over isn't up to par. If they can't even hear what you have to say due to voice quality issues, how can they be interested? It's time to concentrate on the sound now. It is where you put together the narration, music, and sound effects to provide the audience the best experience possible.

 If you're just starting off, this step could seem a little intimidating. Consider employing a professional with built-in tools to achieve it effectively if you're searching for someone with expertise and experience using editing software. Furthermore, background music may provide pacing, intrigue, and a sense of setting to the film.

## **Part 3: Utilize Professional Video Editing Software for Post-Production**

Different explainer video creators will provide you access to effects and asset libraries, which will make creating your video easier.

 Focusing on the visuals of your Shorts can enhance viewer engagement and make your content stand out. Aesthetically pleasing visuals capture viewers' attention. Dynamic aesthetics maintain their interest throughout the video. Unique and engaging elements also make your videos more memorable.

### 5\. Optimize the Viewing Options
