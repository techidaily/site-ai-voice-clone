   1. **AI Live Script Generation:** Are you unable to brainstorm engaging pinpoints for your product selling? Use the AI Script feature of Wondershare Virbo Live and get a compelling script by describing your needs. You can even select a script tone from marketing to specialization options.
   2. **AI Translation:** To attract a diverse audience, you need videos in different languages. Therefore, Virbo Live offers a feature to translate your script into another language. Apart from that, a dubbing option holds AI voices of different languages and accents.
   3. **AI Avatars:** If you are a camera-shy person but live selling is a need of your business, use AI Avatars as a dynamic shift to progress. They can mimic real-life nuances while showing various ethnicities and attires. You pick one via scrolling, standing, or sitting pose avatars.
