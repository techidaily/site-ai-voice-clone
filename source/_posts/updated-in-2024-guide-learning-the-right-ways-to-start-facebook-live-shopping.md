For that, lead to the "**Text Script"** or "**Audio Upload"** section to add the appropriate voiceover. Define your voice from the available list and set its parameters, or upload your pre-recorded voice to add along with the avatar.

Add Voiceover

#### Step 3\. Perform Other Edits to Video

After selecting the avatar and voiceover for the video, you can perform other edits as well. Change the background of the video or add music in the background according to your choice. If you want to display the subtitles across the video, enable the "**Subtitle**" option. Furthermore, for more advanced settings in your video, you can define a proper **"Layout**" or add stickers and edit text style on the top toolbar.
