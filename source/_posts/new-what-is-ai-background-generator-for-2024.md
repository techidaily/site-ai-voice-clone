Since the release of Chat GPT, various platforms have been integrating **AI streaming** to offer a better experience to the viewers. This has players in the broadcasting scene and media utilizing**artificial intelligence streaming** in some of the most distinguished ways. In this article, we will explore how AI has elevated the streaming experience and recommend a tool you can use to enhance your offerings.

 Artificial intelligence has quickly revolutionized many industries, including the entertainment industry. Many providers have recently opted to bet on AI streaming services to elevate their game. With artificial intelligence streaming becoming more popular, online broadcasters now offer more value to their viewers. Services like Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, TikTok, YouTube, and many more are using AI algorithms for multiple purposes.

### **01 What is AI streaming?**

 AI streaming involves the use of artificial intelligence solutions to enhance video quality, create rich metadata, reduce piracy, personalize content, and more. Streaming providers are implementing AI this was as part of their core business function.

![ai streaming](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/level-up-your-ai-streaming-game-a-quick-guide-and-tool-recommendation-1.jpg)

 In AI streaming, algorithms study people’s viewing history, behaviors, and preferences to provide tailormade and enjoyable experiences. The technology is also being used to promote relevant shows and movies that keep users on their platforms instead of moving to another one.

### **02 How artificial intelligence enhances the streaming experience**

 The use of artificial intelligence streams helps platforms stand out by providing relevant content. Platforms can use artificial intelligence to manage most of the processes in video streaming. This includes selection, content recommendation, and montage. As more uses of artificial intelligence streaming emerge, here are some notable impacts:

1. **AI-Powered Localization:** Platforms adapt their language and cultural approaches to enter foreign markets. With AI, the process of capturing, translating, and uploading subtitles is automated. Platforms like IMDB also use AI to source content titles, descriptions, and technical details.
2. **Audience Engagement:** With the help of machine language, platforms can accurately keep their audience engaged. AI helps to translate social media posts, catalog information, canned chat responses, knowledgebases, FAQs, website pages, and manuals.
3. **Content Protection:** With AI stream, platforms can protect their content and enhance user experience. AI helps to identify pirated streams, taking them down in a matter of minutes. It can also extract digital watermarks of pirated content and prevent users from abusing the service. By blocking such users, AI is a powerful tool in protecting the monetization of platforms with premium content and AI live streams.
4. **Video Encoding Enhancement:** Artificial intelligence helps platforms improve the way videos are encoded. Rather than processing a file with the same settings, AI reads the video frames and adjusts the settings for maximum compression. As a result, you get better image quality at a lower cost related to data storage and transfer.
5. **Improve Watching Experience:** AI automatically detects credits and allows viewers to skip them to avoid interrupting the watching experience. For instance, the American streaming service Plex relies on a machine-learning algorithm to analyze videos and find the start of the credits sequence. It instructs the frontend viewer by displaying a “Skip Credits” button when the viewer reaches that point.
