 A driver cannot load on this device error message by Program Compatibility Assistant

 If you’re seeing**_A driver cannot load on this device_** error on your computer, no need to worry much about it, since it’s a rather common issue for many Windows 10 and Windows 11 users. According to Microsoft:

> _Though the driver has a minor vulnerability that’s preventing it from loading, it’s most likely not malicious in any way._

 In other words, the mentioned driver won’t do much harm to your computer even if you don’t do anything with the error message. Based on our experience, the mentioned driver in the**_A driver cannot load on this device_** message is most likely just too old for your new operating system.

 But if you’re bothered by this error very much, you can still try the methods in this post to get it sorted.

## 1\. Update related driver via Windows Update

 If your system isn’t updated regularly, or if you deliberately disable or delay Windows Update, the mentioned driver might not get updated in time, and thus the**_A driver cannot load on this device_** error. So one of the first things you need to do is to make sure that you’ve installed all available Windows Update patches. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .

3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Restart your computer for the update to take effect if needed.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20.png)
4. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll see**You’re up to date** like this.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21.png)

 Restart your computer, and see if the**_A driver cannot load on this device_** error still remains. If the problem persists, please move on.

## 2\. Update related driver via its manufacturer

 If Windows Update can’t help to install the mentioned driver, you’ll need to see if you can download and install the driver via its manufacturer manually. And you can get more detailed information from the driver description in the error message.

 For instance, in this screenshot, the driver I’m having a problem with is**_CY3014.X64_** :

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-68.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082542/7443" target="_top" id="2082542">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/>
</a>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082542/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 When I Google_**CY3014.X64**_ , I see that it’s a file for the**Elgato Game Capture HD60 S device** . By searching the device name plus driver (i.e. Elgato Game Capture HD60 S driver), I land on this page:[https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027961152-Elgato-Gaming-Hardware-Drivers](https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027961152-Elgato-Gaming-Hardware-Drivers) , where I can download and later install the correct driver for my computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-69.png)

So in all, to download and install the driver manually, you need to:

1. Search for the driver description mentioned in the error message;
2. use the correct device description plus driver as keywords to search in Google; and
3. download the correct driver that works for your computer operating system.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## 3\. Run Program Compatibility Troubleshooter

 If the above two methods don’t help to fix the**_A driver cannot load on this device_** error for you, it’s time to run the program compatibility troubleshooter, which helps older programs to run properly on newer operating systems like Windows 11 and Windows 10, since as mentioned, the error is usually related to older drivers that can’t run well on newer systems.

To run this troubleshooter:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and the **R**  key together. Copy and paste **ms-settings:troubleshoot** and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-42.png)
2. Select **Other troubleshooters** .

## 4\. Turn off Memory Integrity

 It’s recommended by Microsoft that you turn off Memory Integrity if there are no new drivers for the mentioned driver in the**_A driver cannot load on this device_** message.

 But please note that turning off Memory Integrity disables the functionality that the driver supports. For instance, if the driver mentioned in the error message is about certain features with your keyboard, then these features may not work when you turn Memory Integrity off.

 If this is acceptable to you, please see below how to turn off Memory Integrity:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows**  key and type **core isolation** , then select **Core Isolation** from the list.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-36.png)
2. Toggle off the option for Memory integrity.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-37.png)
3. Restart your computer for the change to take effect.

 Then see if the _**A driver cannot load on this device**_  error still remains.
