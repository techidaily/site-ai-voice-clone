### **2\. Multilingual Support**

This is a handy feature that can help you with many tasks, such as reading, learning, entertainment, accessibility, and more. However, you might wonder if there is a better way to convert text to speech, one that can offer you more options and flexibility. Well, there is, and it is called Virbo, one of the**best text to speech apps for iPhone** .

[Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/ai-voice.html) is an online AI voice generator that can create realistic and diverse voices for any text.

You can also customize the voice parameters, such as speed, pitch, volume, and pause. Moreover, you can add emotions and tones to the voice, such as happy, sad, angry, calm, etc. You can preview and download the voice as an MP3 file and use it for personal or commercial purposes.
