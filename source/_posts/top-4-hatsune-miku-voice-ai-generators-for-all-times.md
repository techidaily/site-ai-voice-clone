 The key is clarity since it will enable you to precisely explain your requirements for team members and resources. Your explainer video's success depends on careful preparation. You must work together without hurrying or falling behind since there will be several connected jobs.

### **Craft a Compelling Script:**

 The screenplay describes all the video's spoken words, whether you're using voiceovers, dialogue, or a mix of the two. During the pre-production phase, we devote a significant amount of time and effort to scriptwriting.

 Consequently, the next and most crucial phase in the creation of animated videos is scriptwriting. It determines if a marketing message will be conveyed to the target audience clearly and, more broadly, whether the video will convert.

### **Select the Right Animation Style and Tools:**

 After the script has been polished and completed, style and formatting are needed. This phase also aids in giving you a general idea of the character that will appear in the video, the color schemes that will be used, the tone, etc. Start by gathering supporting materials for the final film, such as images, videos, and other elements. Referencing your storyboard and keeping a list of the materials your video needs is a smart idea. Animated characters, icons, and images are examples of assets.

 Make the spectator feel as if they are a part of the universe you have created. This is a challenging step since you must coordinate all the animations to get the ideal outcome! Along with speech and other significant notes, they often contain instructions for camera angles, tips and changes for lighting, and transitions between scenes.

### **Choose an Appropriate Voice-Over or Narration:**

 Like the majority of experienced writers, brilliant marketers start their videos with voice-over narrations. It's crucial to remember that before the animation process can begin, the voice-over must be recorded.

 The majority of video editing programs provide you access to stock music that you may use in your productions. As an alternative, you may search through a variety of websites with royalty-free music to locate the ideal song for your film.

## **Part 2: The Operation Procedure to Create Animated Explainer Videos**

 Some people may believe that making animated explanation films is simple. The misunderstanding is mostly caused by how brief and uncomplicated many animated videos on social media are. From consulting with customers, selecting ideas, and developing a storyboard to accomplishing business objectives, video production is complicated.

### **Design Captivating Characters or Visual Elements** **:**

 For many years, the customer journey has been heavily influenced by brand identification and brand trust. Finding a simple technique to easily convey your brand to a target demographic is the difficult part. Animated explainer videos excel in this situation. A useful tool for promoting goods, services, concepts, and companies is an animated explainer film. Explainer videos are an innovative marketing strategy that many forward-thinking companies actively include into their operations.

 There are several techniques to animate your films since there is no one approach that works perfectly. Be original and imaginative. You could be unsure about what style to utilize as a result. You should create many instances of the same character because of this. It aids in better appreciating the mood of the video. In this manner, you can choose which fashions suit your brand and the tone of the film the most!

### **Animate the Scenes Using Motion Graphics or Traditional Animation Techniques:**

 The second piece of advice is to make sure your animated film appears just as stunning without sound as it does with it. An animated figure often follows a script in an explainer film, utilizing objects and other visual elements to guide viewers through a process or explain a topic. When developing mascots for a family-oriented product offering, live-action videos may have a significant influence.

 The most enjoyable part is undoubtedly the illustrations! You get to choose and create your characters' environments. Users will be interested and more inclined to watch the video due to the animation. Because of this, it's preferable to employ titers in the film or make your animation seem catchy from the very beginning.

### **Incorporate Suitable Background Music and Sound Effects:**

 The audience won't be interested in the product if the voice-over isn't up to par. If they can't even hear what you have to say due to voice quality issues, how can they be interested? It's time to concentrate on the sound now. It is where you put together the narration, music, and sound effects to provide the audience the best experience possible.

 If you're just starting off, this step could seem a little intimidating. Consider employing a professional with built-in tools to achieve it effectively if you're searching for someone with expertise and experience using editing software. Furthermore, background music may provide pacing, intrigue, and a sense of setting to the film.

## **Part 3: Utilize Professional Video Editing Software for Post-Production**

## Part 3\. What potential risks might AI Marketing have?

With the advent of the AI marketing era, more and more companies or employees are embracing relevant technologies to empower their work. However, AI Marketing may have several potential risks:

#### 1\. Privacy Concerns

AI Marketing relies on collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, which raises privacy concerns. There is a risk of unauthorized access, misuse, or mishandling of personal information, leading to privacy breaches and potential legal issues.

#### 2\. Data Bias and Discrimination

AI algorithms used in marketing may unintentionally incorporate biases present in the data they are trained on. This can lead to discriminatory practices, targeting specific groups unfairly or reinforcing existing societal prejudices.

#### 3\. Lack of Transparency and Explainability

AI algorithms can be complex and challenging to interpret. Lack of transparency and explainability can raise concerns about marketing decisions, making it hard to understand why certain choices or recommendations are being made.

#### 4\. Overreliance on Automation

While automation can bring efficiency and scale to marketing processes, overreliance on AI without human oversight can lead to errors, misunderstandings, and missed opportunities. It's essential to strike a balance between automation and human involvement.

#### 5\. Negative Customer Experience

Poorly designed or implemented AI marketing strategies can result in negative customer experiences. Unintelligent targeting, excessive personalization, or intrusive marketing tactics can alienate customers and damage brand reputation.

#### 6\. Security Risks

AI systems used in marketing can be vulnerable to cyber attacks or hacking attempts. A breach in AI systems can lead to data theft, manipulation, or unauthorized access, posing significant security risks.

#### 7\. Ethical Considerations

AI Marketing raises ethical dilemmas, such as manipulating consumer behavior, creating addictive experiences, or using persuasive tactics that exploit vulnerabilities. Ensuring ethical practices and adhering to regulations are crucial to mitigate potential risks.

To mitigate these risks, it is important to implement strong data protection measures, ensure fairness and accountability in AI algorithms, promote transparency and explainability, conduct regular audits, and prioritize ethical considerations in AI Marketing strategies.
