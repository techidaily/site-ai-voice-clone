## Part 2: 8 Types of Explainer Videos

 Utilizing certain ready-to-use templates can hasten the production of your explainer videos. Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:

### 1. **Whiteboard Animation**

 Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.

![animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg)

### 2. **Motion Graphics**

 This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg)

 One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers' attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.

### 3. **2D animation**

 One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  
  
![animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg)

Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively.

Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!

### 5. **Live-action**

 Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.
