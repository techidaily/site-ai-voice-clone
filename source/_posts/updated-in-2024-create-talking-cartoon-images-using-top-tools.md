#### Step 3\. Upload You Video

 A pop-up window will appear, and you must follow the prompts to get started with your video translation! Before uploading your original video file, here are some tips you must bear in mind:

1. The recommended video duration and format is a 10s-2min MP4 file.
2. Uploaded videos should contain authentic voices. The translation function is only affected by human voices.
3. Video translation only supports voiceover content. You can not translate the songs or any BGM in the video.
4. Avoid any background noise or music, as they can reduce the quality of the audio output.
5. The video resolution must be between 480x480 and 1920x1920.
