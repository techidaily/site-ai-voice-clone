Nowadays, you can harness the power of AI to create professional videos and audio narrations to pass your message effectively. So, in this post, we will help you find the best **real time AI voice changer** and some possible uses for this program. Let’s dig in!

## **Part 1\. How real time AI voice changers work**

 A**real time voice changer AI** is a program that has been extensively trained using deep machine learning algorithms to create a virtual clone of human voices. These programs work by creating a large data set of diverse audio clips, allowing them to analyze your live voice and transform it into your input prompt.

However, sometimes, you may need to enter a text data prompt using speech-to-text AI voice cloning services. Whichever model you choose, the speech training model can take a few minutes or hours to clone your voice.

 But AI voice cloners don’t work independently. Instead, these tools allow you to make post-processing adjustments to make your AI voice sound how you want it. For example, you can make sound adjustments like pitch, tone, emotion, etc. Overall, the AI voice cloning process is pretty complex, although the process on your side may take just a few clicks.

 Visit the official website of[TikTok Live Studio](https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download?utm%5Fsource=creator%5Fhub&download%5Fsource=creator%5Fhub) and download it for your Windows. But you can also log in to your TikTok account and download Live Studio from there. But if you don’t see the TikTok Live Studio download button in your TikTok app, then that means the software might not be available in your region.

##### Step 2 Install and Login TikTok Live Studio

 After completing the download, you need to install the software on your Windows PC or laptop. Give it all the permission that it needs and after you are done installing it on your machine, you need to log in just like you log in to your TikTok. The application will allow you to choose various options like Facebook, Google, and Twitter login.

##### Step 3 Setting up LIVE Studio and going live

 Once you are logged in, you can either skip the process or Set Up so that everything will go under your supervision. You will need to select things like Microphone, Camera settings, Streaming Settings, and more. Once everything is set up, you just need to click**Go Live,** and your live stream will be started.

## Conclusion

 TikTok Live Studio is one of the best live streaming tools you will find. The regular TikTok app is quite limited, especially if you are a streamer trying to make it on the TikTok world.

 There is so much competition on the**TikTok streaming service,** but with Live Studio, you get a lot of freedom and tools to measure your progress in the competitive TikTok world.
