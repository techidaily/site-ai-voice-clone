It is an AI tool that offers multilingual AI-driven avatars for seamless shopping broadcasting.

 You can set up a customized Q/A database for automatic queries using this tool. Plus, it is compatible with almost all social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Not only that, but you can also dive into its prominent features, which are explained below for more insights:

   1. **AI Live Script Generation:** Are you unable to brainstorm engaging pinpoints for your product selling? Use the AI Script feature of Wondershare Virbo Live and get a compelling script by describing your needs. You can even select a script tone from marketing to specialization options.
   2. **AI Translation:** To attract a diverse audience, you need videos in different languages. Therefore, Virbo Live offers a feature to translate your script into another language. Apart from that, a dubbing option holds AI voices of different languages and accents.
   3. **AI Avatars:** If you are a camera-shy person but live selling is a need of your business, use AI Avatars as a dynamic shift to progress. They can mimic real-life nuances while showing various ethnicities and attires. You pick one via scrolling, standing, or sitting pose avatars.
