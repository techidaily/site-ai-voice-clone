 Making videos means increasing the online presence of content. In contrast, translating videos means promoting your content and making it available to all. Remember that only 20% of the world's population speaks English, but 100 million people watch video content. Thus, content creators **translate live videos** to English to rank their content for wider accessibility.

In this way, you can build trust and credibility among viewers. Moreover, your translated content will comply with the legal standards.
