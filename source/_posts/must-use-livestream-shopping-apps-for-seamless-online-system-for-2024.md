[Tubi](https://tubitv.com/) might be more focused on movies and shows, but it also has 10 free stream channels for sports of most categories out there. It has a very user-friendly interface, however, there are still ads that would occasionally come and affect your sports-watching experience.

 But the tool displays fewer ads than our conventional cable and there is literally no subscription required. The interesting thing about Tubi is its compatibility. While you can watch most sports shows on the internet, it also supports various platforms like Android, iOS, SONY, LG, Chromecast, and a lot more.

 The only downside of using Tubi is that it shows 3 or 4 ads every 15 minutes, which is not too bad. But if we talk about**streaming websites for free sports,** it is still a great platform to watch some of your favorite sports shows.
