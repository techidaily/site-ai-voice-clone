 Eminem (Marshall Bruce Mathers III) will feature highly on the list when mentioning legendary musicians. Eminem is an American-born rapper born in 1972\. He is credited for helping popularize hip-hop and is among the best-selling rappers of the 20th and 21st centuries. It's estimated that Eminem has worldwide sales of over 220 million records and was the best-selling musician in the US in the early 2000s.

 That said, Eminem has one of the most unique voices in the music industry. The rapper has managed to change his voice with ease over the years. He is comfortable with low notes and can efficiently ascend as high as possible. Interestingly, David Guetta recently revealed that he used an**AI voice generator for Eminem** to replicate the rapper's voice. This shows just how much AI technology is touching on multiple industries.

## **Part 2\. Reasons Why You Need Eminem AI Voice Generator?**

 Throughout the past few years, more AI-generated content has been introduced in platforms like TikTok, Facebook Reels, YouTube, etc. Today, you can find multiple videos with smooth AI narration in almost any industry. For example, music fans have been transforming popular songs using AI programs to make them sound like they are sung by another person.

 In January, Drayk.it made trending headlines after making Drake songs using AI. However, the platform did not last long and is currently unavailable due to legal issues concerning image rights from the famous Canadian rapper. Several artists and industries have since expressed their dislike for the widespread AI technology.

 With that in mind, below are some of the reasons why you should use an Eminem voice generator:

* Create custom phone and alarm ringtones.
* Narrate funny or motivational video stories with Eminem's voice.
* Practice singing by writing lyrics and finding out how the sentences flow.
* Prank friends online on social media apps like TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.
