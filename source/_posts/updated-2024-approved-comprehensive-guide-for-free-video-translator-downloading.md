AI advertising relies on a large amount of user data for targeting and personalized recommendations, which can raise concerns about user privacy. Improper data handling and usage could lead to data breaches or misuse, resulting in privacy infringements.

#### 2.Bias and discrimination

AI algorithms used in advertising may be influenced by their own biases and prejudices. If algorithms are trained on biased or insufficiently diverse data, it could result in ads that target or exclude specific groups, leading to unfairness and discrimination.

#### 3.Fraud and false information

While AI advertising can predict and prevent fraud, there is still a risk of fraudulent activities and the spread of incorrect information through AI advertising systems. Malicious advertisers may exploit AI technology to deceive users or engage in fraudulent activities, undermining user rights and trust.

#### 4.Lack of human judgment and creativity

Although AI advertising can automate and optimize ad delivery, it may lack human judgment and creativity. Some advertising campaigns require more emotional appeal and creative factors that AI technology may have limitations in delivering.

To address these risks, regulatory agencies and relevant stakeholders need to establish appropriate policies and standards to ensure the compliance and ethicality of AI advertising. Technology developers and advertising practitioners should also strengthen monitoring, validation, and review processes for AI advertising systems to mitigate potential risks and issues.
