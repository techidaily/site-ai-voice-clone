## Part 2: Where Can You Download Talking Stock Photos For Free?

 “Okay, I’m sold on talking photos! Where can I get them?”

 Glad you asked! We have collated a repository of 6 portals that offer quality talking stock photos and talking stock images that you can choose and use!

 **Difference Between Talking Stock Photos and Talking Stock Images**

 What is the difference between talking stock photos and talking stock images? Photos are images taken from a camera system. Images could be anything – from actual photos to graphics created on a computer.

#### 2.1: Getty Images

![getty images talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-2.jpg)

 What self-respecting journalist or newsreader does not know about Getty Images? Getty has a repertoire of over 7,935,000 high-quality talking photos for you to choose from. That all but guarantees that you will be able to find the ones you want and like.

#### 2.2: Shutterstock

![shutterstock talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-3.jpg)

 If Getty’s 7,935,000 talking photos didn’t fit the bill, maybe Shutterstock is for you. You can search from a database of over 4,549,000 talking photos. Certainly, something will catch your fancy with Shutterstock!

#### 2.3: Unsplash

![unsplash talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-4.jpg)

 Unsplash has been making a splash since 2013 with high-quality stock imagery for everyone. So much so, that in 2021, it was acquired by Getty Images. Unsplash users will not have a lot to work with in terms of talking photos, though. The repository seems to be somewhat small at the moment at over 1700 talking photos only.

#### 2.4: Pexels

![pexels talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-5.jpg)

 Pexels was founded in Germany just about a decade ago in 2014 and has since grown to house over 3.2 million free stock photos and videos. The platform features over 411,000 talking photos for you to choose from. Pexels is part of Canva since 2018, just 4 years since its release. Must be doing something great, right?

#### 2.5: Pixabay

![pixabay talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-6.jpg)

 Pixabay is another German startup that has been serving the internet community since 2010\. Pixabay houses over 4.4 million photos and stock imagery, out of which over 3000 are talking photos. Not a great database, admittedly, but still worth a look if you are not satisfied with the others! Pixabay, like Pexels in 2018, was acquired by Canva in 2019.

#### 2.6: Freepik

![freepik talking photos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/talking-stock-photo-7.jpg)

 Freepik has been around since 2010 and is part of the Freepik Company that features other brands such as Flaticon, Slidesgo and Wepik. Freepik has over 1,052,000 talking photos for you to choose from.

The AI then processes this input and generates a corresponding headshot that matches the desired criteria.

These generators can be used for various purposes, including creating profile pictures, avatars, character images for games or storytelling, and even for artistic or creative projects. It's worth noting that while these generators can produce impressive results, they might sometimes unintentionally perpetuate certain biases present in the training data, which is an important consideration when using such tools.

Before utilizing AI-generated headshots in a professional context, ensuring that the images' quality and realism meet your standards is crucial. The headshots should look natural and professional, without any apparent distortions or artifacts.

### 2\. Consistency

AI-generated headshots can offer a consistent visual aesthetic across your team's profiles or marketing materials. It can help establish a cohesive brand identity and create a polished impression.

### 3\. Time and Cost Efficiency

Generating headshots with AI can be quicker and more cost-effective than scheduling and conducting photoshoots for every individual. It is particularly useful when working with large teams or for time-sensitive projects

### 4\. Personal Data Privacy

When using AI to generate headshots, you don't need to collect personal photographs of your team members. It can help address privacy concerns arising from collecting and using private photos.

### 5\. Ethical Considerations

Considering any ethical implications of using AI-generated content is essential. Transparency is critical—let your audience know if the images are AI-generated, not actual photographs.

### 6\. Diversity and Inclusion

AI-generated headshots should reflect diversity and inclusivity. Ensure that your tool has been trained on a diverse dataset to avoid unintentional biases in gender, ethnicity, age, etc.

### 7\. Customization

Some AI headshot generators allow customization, such as adjusting facial expressions, hairstyles, and other features. This can help tailor the generated images to match your brand's unique style.

### 8\. Legal Considerations

Be aware of copyright or licensing issues related to the AI-generated images. Ensure you have the right to use and distribute the photos for your intended purposes.

Ultimately, the decision to use AI-generated headshots in professional settings depends on your specific needs and the industry in which you operate. As AI technology improves, these generated images will likely become even more convincing and versatile for various applications.
