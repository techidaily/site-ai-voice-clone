2. **Speech Recognition:** The AI system extracts the audio and converts it into text. In the case of only subtitle files, the systems will recognize the language of the uploaded SRT.
3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.

## What Is AI Advertising? | Wondershare Virbo Glossary

## Part 1\. How is AI used in advertising?

AI is used in advertising in various ways to optimize campaigns, personalize messaging, and improve targeting. Here are some common applications of AI in advertising:

#### **01**of 08Audience targeting

AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and preferences among different user segments. This allows advertisers to target specific demographics or individuals with relevant advertisements based on their browsing behavior, demographics, interests, and previous interactions.

#### **02**of 08Ad optimization

AI can automatically optimize ad campaigns by adjusting real-time parameters such as ad creative, placement, and bidding strategies. Machine learning algorithms analyze data on user responses and continuously refine ad delivery to maximize performance and achieve campaign objectives.

#### **03**of 08Predictive analytics

AI enables advertisers to make data-driven decisions by using predictive analytics. Machine learning algorithms analyze historical data to forecast future trends, customer behavior, and potential campaign outcomes. This helps advertisers allocate budgets effectively and optimize their strategies accordingly.

#### **04**of 08Ad creation

AI tools can generate ad content automatically by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. These systems can create personalized ad copy, generate product descriptions, and design visuals based on user preferences and brand guidelines.

#### **05**of 08Chatbots and virtual assistants

AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are used in advertising to provide personalized customer support, answer queries, and guide users through the buyer's journey. They can offer recommendations based on user preferences, provide information about products or services, and even complete transactions.

#### **06**of 08Dynamic pricing

AI algorithms can analyze market trends, competitor pricing, and customer behavior to determine optimal pricing strategies. AI empowers advertisers to dynamically modify prices based on factors like demand, inventory levels, and customer segmentation, with the ultimate goal of optimizing revenue and profitability.

#### **07**of 08Ad fraud detection

AI algorithms can detect fraudulent activities in advertising, such as click fraud, impression fraud, or fake accounts. By analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns, AI systems can help prevent ad fraud, protect advertiser investments, and ensure campaign performance accuracy.

#### **08**of 08Customer segmentation and profiling

AI enables advertisers to segment customers based on their preferences, behavior, and characteristics. This allows personalized advertising campaigns that resonate with specific customer segments, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.

## Part 2\. What advantages does AI advertising have compared to traditional advertising?

AI advertising has several advantages over traditional advertising:

#### 1.Intelligent targeting and personalized recommendations

AI advertising can accurately target and make personalized recommendations to users through data analysis and machine learning algorithms. It analyzes users' interests, behaviors, and preferences to deliver relevant and appealing ads, increasing click-through and conversion rates.

#### 2.Real-time optimization and precision

AI advertising can monitor ad performance in real time and optimize it based on user feedback and data metrics. It adjusts ad content, channels, and delivery strategies to improve ad relevance and effectiveness, giving advertisers better control over their ad budgets and outcomes.

#### 3.Automation and efficiency

AI advertising automates ad delivery, reducing manual intervention and labor costs. Advertisers can manage ad campaigns more efficiently and achieve better results by automating ad buying, placement, and optimization.

#### 4.Data-driven insights

AI advertising leverages data analysis and mining to provide deeper insights and decision support. Advertisers can better understand user behavior patterns, market trends, and competitor insights through data analysis, enabling them to make informed advertising decisions.

#### 5.Creative optimization and personalized content creation

AI advertising helps optimize ad creatives and content using machine learning and generative models. It generates personalized ad copy, images, and videos that cater to user needs and preferences, enhancing ad creativity and interactivity.

Overall, AI advertising harnesses the power of data and algorithms to deliver more accurate, intelligent, and personalized ads, improving ad effectiveness and user experience and generating better performance and returns for advertisers.

## Part 3\. Potential risks and challenges in AI advertising

#### 1.Privacy concerns

AI advertising relies on a large amount of user data for targeting and personalized recommendations, which can raise concerns about user privacy. Improper data handling and usage could lead to data breaches or misuse, resulting in privacy infringements.

#### 2.Bias and discrimination

AI algorithms used in advertising may be influenced by their own biases and prejudices. If algorithms are trained on biased or insufficiently diverse data, it could result in ads that target or exclude specific groups, leading to unfairness and discrimination.

#### 3.Fraud and false information

While AI advertising can predict and prevent fraud, there is still a risk of fraudulent activities and the spread of incorrect information through AI advertising systems. Malicious advertisers may exploit AI technology to deceive users or engage in fraudulent activities, undermining user rights and trust.

#### 4.Lack of human judgment and creativity

Although AI advertising can automate and optimize ad delivery, it may lack human judgment and creativity. Some advertising campaigns require more emotional appeal and creative factors that AI technology may have limitations in delivering.

To address these risks, regulatory agencies and relevant stakeholders need to establish appropriate policies and standards to ensure the compliance and ethicality of AI advertising. Technology developers and advertising practitioners should also strengthen monitoring, validation, and review processes for AI advertising systems to mitigate potential risks and issues.
