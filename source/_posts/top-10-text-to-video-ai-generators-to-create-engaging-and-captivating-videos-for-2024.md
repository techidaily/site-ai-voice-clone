Afterward, the AI tool adds visual elements and effects to make a creative video. If the video is animated, the tool adds a sense of motion to the objects, backgrounds, and characters.

 Moreover, human emotion is also added according to the script's demand. If there are dialogues between the characters, the AI tool will use its TTS engine to produce voiceovers. During this process, relevant background music and sound effects are added to ensure the captivity of the video. Once the visual and audio data is generated, the tool merges each scene smartly.

 This rendering process also includes lip-syncing, transitions, and overall timing. Some AI tools also introduce quality control techniques to eliminate errors from the video.

## How to Make Animated Explainer Videos

 Explainer films are among the easiest and most inventive methods to present a project, a product, a service, or pretty much anything else you can imagine. In reality, the demand for an explanation film increases with product complexity. Fortunately, with the help of some of the fantastic explainer video software tools available online, you may be able to accomplish it yourself.

![animated-explainer-video.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-video.jpg)

 You'll find a few tools in this article that will let you sit down and make whatever kind of explainer film you want. An overview of the key components required for a successful explainer video is provided at the bottom.

## **Part 1: The Preparation Stage of Animated Explainers**

 An explainer video's primary goal is to improve the company's marketing plan. They are so distinctive and ultimately successful because of this. However, for the creation process to be successful, it must also include all participants and be open and transparent. The process may sometimes be full of intriguing and surprising answers at any point, or it might reach a dead end. Actually, the whole creative process is quite orderly and transparent. Here is a list of the actions you need to do to complete it successfully.

### **Define Your Target Audience and Purpose:**

 The process often begins with project research, which includes gathering data from the customer, doing a market study, and completing product research.

 The key is clarity since it will enable you to precisely explain your requirements for team members and resources. Your explainer video's success depends on careful preparation. You must work together without hurrying or falling behind since there will be several connected jobs.

### **Craft a Compelling Script:**

 The screenplay describes all the video's spoken words, whether you're using voiceovers, dialogue, or a mix of the two. During the pre-production phase, we devote a significant amount of time and effort to scriptwriting.

 Consequently, the next and most crucial phase in the creation of animated videos is scriptwriting. It determines if a marketing message will be conveyed to the target audience clearly and, more broadly, whether the video will convert.

### **Select the Right Animation Style and Tools:**

 After the script has been polished and completed, style and formatting are needed. This phase also aids in giving you a general idea of the character that will appear in the video, the color schemes that will be used, the tone, etc. Start by gathering supporting materials for the final film, such as images, videos, and other elements. Referencing your storyboard and keeping a list of the materials your video needs is a smart idea. Animated characters, icons, and images are examples of assets.

 Make the spectator feel as if they are a part of the universe you have created. This is a challenging step since you must coordinate all the animations to get the ideal outcome! Along with speech and other significant notes, they often contain instructions for camera angles, tips and changes for lighting, and transitions between scenes.

### **Choose an Appropriate Voice-Over or Narration:**

 Like the majority of experienced writers, brilliant marketers start their videos with voice-over narrations. It's crucial to remember that before the animation process can begin, the voice-over must be recorded.

 The majority of video editing programs provide you access to stock music that you may use in your productions. As an alternative, you may search through a variety of websites with royalty-free music to locate the ideal song for your film.

## **Part 2: The Operation Procedure to Create Animated Explainer Videos**

 Some people may believe that making animated explanation films is simple. The misunderstanding is mostly caused by how brief and uncomplicated many animated videos on social media are. From consulting with customers, selecting ideas, and developing a storyboard to accomplishing business objectives, video production is complicated.

### **Design Captivating Characters or Visual Elements** **:**

 For many years, the customer journey has been heavily influenced by brand identification and brand trust. Finding a simple technique to easily convey your brand to a target demographic is the difficult part. Animated explainer videos excel in this situation. A useful tool for promoting goods, services, concepts, and companies is an animated explainer film. Explainer videos are an innovative marketing strategy that many forward-thinking companies actively include into their operations.

 There are several techniques to animate your films since there is no one approach that works perfectly. Be original and imaginative. You could be unsure about what style to utilize as a result. You should create many instances of the same character because of this. It aids in better appreciating the mood of the video. In this manner, you can choose which fashions suit your brand and the tone of the film the most!

### **Animate the Scenes Using Motion Graphics or Traditional Animation Techniques:**

 The second piece of advice is to make sure your animated film appears just as stunning without sound as it does with it. An animated figure often follows a script in an explainer film, utilizing objects and other visual elements to guide viewers through a process or explain a topic. When developing mascots for a family-oriented product offering, live-action videos may have a significant influence.

 The most enjoyable part is undoubtedly the illustrations! You get to choose and create your characters' environments. Users will be interested and more inclined to watch the video due to the animation. Because of this, it's preferable to employ titers in the film or make your animation seem catchy from the very beginning.

### **Incorporate Suitable Background Music and Sound Effects:**

 The audience won't be interested in the product if the voice-over isn't up to par. If they can't even hear what you have to say due to voice quality issues, how can they be interested? It's time to concentrate on the sound now. It is where you put together the narration, music, and sound effects to provide the audience the best experience possible.

 If you're just starting off, this step could seem a little intimidating. Consider employing a professional with built-in tools to achieve it effectively if you're searching for someone with expertise and experience using editing software. Furthermore, background music may provide pacing, intrigue, and a sense of setting to the film.

## **Part 3: Utilize Professional Video Editing Software for Post-Production**

## What Is an AI Text Generator?

## Part 1\. What is an AI text generator?

An AI text generator, also known as a language model, is a software or system that uses artificial intelligence techniques, particularly natural language processing (NLP), to generate human-like text based on the input it receives.

Such as OpenAI, AI text generators can produce a wide range of text, including articles, stories, emails, product descriptions, etc. They can be used for various purposes, such as content creation, chatbots, virtual assistants, and even assisting in writing and editing tasks. The generated text aims to mimic human language and can be customized based on prompts or specific requirements.

## Part 2\. What's the working principle of AI text generators?

The AI text generator operates primarily based on deep learning and natural language processing techniques. It uses neural network models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or variants such as extended short-term memory networks (LSTMs) or transformer models.

During the training phase, the AI text generator receives vast text data as input. This data can include books, articles, web pages, conversational records, and more. The model learns natural language patterns by analyzing the statistical characteristics, grammar rules, and semantic associations present in the text data.

The generation of text occurs character by character or word by word. During the generation process, the model predicts the next character or phrase based on the input context and preceding text, ensuring coherence and relevance in the generated output. The objective is to generate text that aligns with the input information and flows naturally.

To enhance the quality of the generated text, AI text generators often undergo extensive pre-training and fine-tuning processes. In the pre-training phase, the model is trained on massive amounts of text data to learn the fundamental features of the language. The model is further adjusted and optimized in the fine-tuning phase through supervised training on specific tasks.

## Part 3\. In which scenarios can AI text generators be applied?

AI text generators can be applied in various scenarios, serving as valuable bridges between different languages, cultures, and industries. They facilitate communication and understanding by providing translations, transcriptions, and interpretations across linguistic and cultural boundaries. This enables global collaboration, cultural exchange, and accessibility to information for diverse audiences.

In addition to bridging gaps, AI text generators find applications in content creation, chatbots and virtual assistants, creative writing, language translation, customer support, social media marketing, personalized recommendations, text summarization, proofreading and editing, research and data analysis, as well as in legal and healthcare sectors. They assist in generating articles, blog posts, product descriptions, and scholarly papers, automate responses, inspire creativity, condense information, aid in drafting legal documents and medical reports, and much more.

As AI text generation technology advances, it opens up new opportunities in journalism, content localization, e-learning, and beyond.

## Part 4\. In using an AI text generator, what should we consider?

AI text generators have promising development prospects and are continuously advancing in their capabilities. However, there are a few key aspects to keep in mind:

#### 1\. Accuracy and Quality

While AI text generators have made significant progress, there can still be generated text that may contain errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. It's important to review and verify the generated content for accuracy and ensure it aligns with your intended message.

#### 2\. Ethical Considerations

AI text generators should be used responsibly, considering ethical implications. The technology can be used maliciously by generating fake news or spreading misinformation. Awareness of the ethical use of AI-generated text is crucial to maintaining trust and credibility.

#### 3\. Domain and Context Specificity

AI text generators may struggle with domain-specific or highly technical content that requires specialized knowledge. While they can generate general text, human experts may still be needed for more complex or nuanced writing tasks.

#### 4\. Intellectual Property and Copyright

When using AI text generators, it's important to be mindful of intellectual property rights and copyright. Some generated text may inadvertently infringe upon existing content, so verifying the originality and uniqueness of the generated output is crucial.

By considering these factors, monitoring advancements in the field, and implementing responsible practices, the development prospects for AI text generators remain promising, enabling us to leverage their capabilities effectively while ensuring ethical and quality outcomes.
