#### 2.Bias and discrimination

AI algorithms used in advertising may be influenced by their own biases and prejudices. If algorithms are trained on biased or insufficiently diverse data, it could result in ads that target or exclude specific groups, leading to unfairness and discrimination.

#### 3.Fraud and false information

While AI advertising can predict and prevent fraud, there is still a risk of fraudulent activities and the spread of incorrect information through AI advertising systems. Malicious advertisers may exploit AI technology to deceive users or engage in fraudulent activities, undermining user rights and trust.

#### 4.Lack of human judgment and creativity

Although AI advertising can automate and optimize ad delivery, it may lack human judgment and creativity. Some advertising campaigns require more emotional appeal and creative factors that AI technology may have limitations in delivering.

To address these risks, regulatory agencies and relevant stakeholders need to establish appropriate policies and standards to ensure the compliance and ethicality of AI advertising. Technology developers and advertising practitioners should also strengthen monitoring, validation, and review processes for AI advertising systems to mitigate potential risks and issues.

 As live shopping becomes more common among buyers and sellers, choosing the right content is integral to success. Virbo Live allows you to experience cost-effective and multilingual AI streamers that will boost your revenues during your live shopping experience. By using Virbo Live, you can transform the live experience in the following ways:

#### 1\. Realistic AI-driven Avatars

 Elevate your live shop engagement with an AI streamer or Vtuber that will mimic natural movement naturally when presenting and interacting with the audience. The AI-powered avatars mirror real-life nuances, including poses and attire. By being authentic and relatable, the AI streamers will make the live shopping experience as realistic as possible.

#### 2\. Multiple Languages and Accents

 Integrate the right language and accent to match your audience through the AI streamers. By breaking the language barriers, the AI streamer allows you to reach a diverse audience and make sure they connect with your content.

#### 3\. AI Translation

 Effortlessly translate your text into multiple languages and generate a script for your AI streamer. This broadens your product reach, allowing you to achieve a global live shopping experience for your target audience.

#### 4\. AI Live Shopping Script Generation

 Generate a script for your AI streamer automatically, saving you time and effort. Allow your AI streamer to speak your mind and ensure a seamless flow of captivating content during the live shopping experience.

#### 5\. Customizable Q&A Repository

 Create a personalized Q&A database for your AI streamer to connect more naturally with your audience. This feature allows you to set up automatic responses to questions, ensuring your viewers feel valued.

#### 6\. Microphone Integration for Voice-Driven AI

 Get your AI-powered avatar to speak in real time by connecting and speaking into the microphone. What you speak into the microphone is automatically replicated by the AI streamer during the event.

#### 7\. Interaction Through Text

 Trigger and get your AI streamer to speak based on your own written text. You only need to enter the text that you want and click Send. The AI streamer will then speech what you have typed.

#### 8\. Cloud-Based Operation

 Virbo Live offers you more freedom with the cloud-based operation. All the features are available online, and you do not have to struggle downloading any software. Operate directly from the cloud and freely manage your product.

## Conclusion

 TalkShopLive offers sellers and shoppers a unique experience to sell and buy products during live shows. The platform is specially designed to help in the distribution, collaboration, and sharing of a truly shoppable and social video experience.

 As a social-selling network, Talk Shop Live allows users to interact with each other and make informed purchase decisions. However, hiring a human streamer and preparing their content can be time-consuming and expensive. That’s why we recommend [Virbo Live](https://virbo.wondershare.com/virbo-live.html) as the future of live-stream shopping. Get access to AI-powered avatars that will keep your viewers engaged while boosting your revenue from live-stream events.
