The simple answer is that you cannot<strong>translate SRT</strong> subtitles online and reach a global audience by yourself. You might know one language, or two, or maybe five or ten. Twenty? Okay, you might know 20 languages. According to UNESCO World Atlas of Languages (UNESCO WAL) there are over 7000 languages in use. You certainly do not need to know or translate into those many.</p><p> To reach a global audience of 195 countries (193 recognized by UN) you only need a handful, and you might be able to get by with what you know. But, how about using an online SRT file translator to get the job done faster, more accurately, and in a greater number of languages than you can? This way, you free up your time to do more important tasks than being a translator!</p><ul><li>Online SRT translation is fast.</li><li>Online SRT translation is efficient and timesaving.</li><li>Online SRT translation is accurate (depending on chosen tool).</li><li>Online SRT translation translates into many more languages than we know.</li><li>Online SRT translation allows us to reach a larger audience.</li><li>Content engagement shoots up due to wider availability of subtitles.</li><li>User retention rate increases as a larger number of users can connect with your content due to subtitles in their native language.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Top-Online-SRT-Translation-Tools"><a href="#Part-2-Top-Online-SRT-Translation-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top Online SRT Translation Tools"></a>Part 2: Top Online SRT Translation Tools</h2><p> What are the top SRT translation tools online available to us today?

Guidelines for Creating Accurate Spanish Translation"></a>Part 3. Guidelines for Creating Accurate Spanish Translation</h2><h5 id="01-of-10-Understand-the-Context"><a href="#01-of-10-Understand-the-Context" class="headerlink" title="01 of 10 Understand the Context"></a><strong>01</strong> of 10 Understand the Context</h5><p> Most AI translation tools lack contextual understanding. Make sure the translated text provides complete sentences or phrases without skipping any important detail.</p><h5 id="02-of-10-Check-the-Formality"><a href="#02-of-10-Check-the-Formality" class="headerlink" title="02 of 10 Check the Formality"></a><strong>02</strong> of 10 Check the Formality</h5><p> Spanish has formal and informal forms of address. Make sure the Spanish to English video translation tool reflects the appropriate level of formality based on the context and relationship between the conversing parties.</p><h5 id="03-of-10-Be-Mindful-of-Idioms"><a href="#03-of-10-Be-Mindful-of-Idioms" class="headerlink" title="03 of 10 Be Mindful of Idioms"></a><strong>03</strong> of 10 Be Mindful of Idioms</h5><p> Idiomatic expressions in Spanish don’t always have direct equivalents in English. AI tools may struggle with these, so be ready to simplify or rephrase to convey the intended message accurately.</p><h5 id="04-of-10-Review-Regional-Variations"><a href="#04-of-10-Review-Regional-Variations" class="headerlink" title="04 of 10 Review Regional Variations"></a><strong>04</strong> of 10 Review Regional Variations</h5><p> Spanish varies across regions. For instance, Spanish in Latin America is vastly different from Spanish in Spain. Therefore, you should consider the target audience’s region and adjust translations accordingly, especially for colloquialisms and regional vocabulary.</p><h5 id="05-of-10-Verify-Technical-Terms"><a href="#05-of-10-Verify-Technical-Terms" class="headerlink" title="05 of 10 Verify Technical Terms"></a><strong>05</strong> of 10 Verify Technical Terms</h5><p> For specialized or technical content, verify that the Spanish video translator understands and translates industry-specific terms correctly. You can provide additional context in the preview if needed.</p><h5 id="06-of-10-Double-Check-Tenses"><a href="#06-of-10-Double-Check-Tenses" class="headerlink" title="06 of 10 Double-Check Tenses"></a><strong>06</strong> of 10 Double-Check Tenses</h5><p> Spanish and English express time differently. Ensure the AI captures the correct tense, especially in complex sentences, to convey the intended temporal meaning accurately.</p><h5 id="07-of-10-Handle-Gender-Sensitively"><a href="#07-of-10-Handle-Gender-Sensitively" class="headerlink" title="07 of 10 Handle Gender Sensitively"></a><strong>07</strong> of 10 Handle Gender Sensitively</h5><p> Spanish had a binary (masculine&#x2F;feminine) gender system only, while US English has multiple. Ensure the AI translates gender-sensitive terms appropriately and consistently throughout the text.</p><h5 id="08-of-10-Consider-Sentence-Structure"><a href="#08-of-10-Consider-Sentence-Structure" class="headerlink" title="08 of 10 Consider Sentence Structure"></a><strong>08</strong> of 10 Consider Sentence Structure</h5><p> Spanish and English have different sentence structures. Verify that the translated text maintains clarity and coherence while respecting the syntactic rules of the target language.</p><h5 id="09-of-10-Proofread-and-Edit"><a href="#09-of-10-Proofread-and-Edit" class="headerlink" title="09 of 10 Proofread and Edit"></a><strong>09</strong> of 10 Proofread and Edit</h5><p> AI tools may not catch nuanced errors. So, if you want to translate voice&#x2F;videos from Spanish into any language, proofread the translated text. Check for grammatical accuracy, style, and overall fluency. Make necessary edits to enhance readability.</p><h5 id="10-of-10-Add-Human-Touch"><a href="#10-of-10-Add-Human-Touch" class="headerlink" title="10 of 10 Add Human Touch"></a><strong>10</strong> of 10 Add Human Touch</h5><p> While AI tools are a great help for translation, they lack the nuanced understanding that humans possess. For critical or sensitive content, consider reviewing the AI-generated translations by a human translator to ensure accuracy and cultural appropriateness</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Breaking language barriers in audio&#x2F;video content is now more accessible than ever. By leveraging a good AI Spanish translation tool like Virbo and following the step-by-step guidance provided above, you can seamlessly<strong>translate Spanish audio to English</strong> or English voice to Spanish.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Engineering-the-Impossible-How-Ordinary-Canned-Air-Reaches-Supersonic-Performance"><a href="#Engineering-the-Impossible-How-Ordinary-Canned-Air-Reaches-Supersonic-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Engineering the Impossible: How Ordinary Canned Air Reaches Supersonic Performance"></a>Engineering the Impossible: How Ordinary Canned Air Reaches Supersonic Performance</h2><p>Ordinary canned air products shoot out jets of gas with a surprising amount of vigor. A precision engineering and machining YouTuber,<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfYlLns0els" >Cylo’s Garage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , noticed telltale ‘shock diamonds’ in the stream emitted by his Staples-branded canned air and felt compelled to investigate further. Using a Schlieren imaging setup, the YouTuber managed to confirm that the humble air duster was pushing out a supersonic flow of gas (h&#x2F;t <a class="link"   href="https://hackaday.com/2024/02/18/canned-air-is-unexpectedly-supersonic/" >Hackaday <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> Like many a fascinating discovery, Cylo’s Garage first noticed the supersonic jets emitted from the canned air nozzle by accident. Checking the air jet with a bright light in the background, confirmed that the Staples Electronics Duster was operational, but upon pulling the trigger fully the YouTuber noticed what looked like shock diamonds…</p><p> For some background, Cylo’s Garage explained that shock diamonds are a type of air pattern commonly visible in the trail of a supersonic jet or rocket. Overlapping shock and expansion waves interfere with one another to create the characteristic diamond shapes in the air. These are easy to see behind a jet or rocket, propelled by fuel combustion, with the light and dark areas in the wake of the engine representing waves of contrasting air density. However, this phenomenon seemed improbable coming from a jet of ordinary canned air with perhaps 70 PSI.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wMGjjqj2ttbEB8vS7vxPqW-320-80.jpg"                      alt="shock diamonds"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Cylo’s Garage)</p><p> About halfway through the video from Cylo’s Garage, we get to see how supersonic air speeds were confirmed using a rudimentary Schlieren imaging setup. All that was needed was a simple lens, a razor blade, an imaging sensor, and a light source. See this test setup, above. This admittedly “janky” set up more or less confirmed shock diamonds in the flow of gas from the can.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Pleased with the first quick experiment, Cylo’s Garage decided to refine the test method and apparatus. At six minutes in, we see a new set of test equipment put together with a far better lens and a columnated light source. From seven and a half minutes you can see the first air jets recorded using the new apparatus.</p><p> Image 1 of 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="shock diamonds"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Cylo’s Garage)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="shock diamonds"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Cylo’s Garage)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="shock diamonds"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Cylo’s Garage)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="shock diamonds"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Cylo’s Garage)</p><p> In tests, the canned air soon ran out of pressure between bursts, but more consistent shock diamonds were pictured from the nozzle of an air compressor (90 PSI).

Scheduled for March 19, the bare metal vs. raw power event is set to become a must-watch experience of the annual CloudFest conference.</p><p> According to the dedicated event page,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/39-year-old-477-mhz-dos-web-server-hits-2500-hours-of-uptime" >server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> throwing began in Holland about a decade ago and is an “intense underground sport, which has been criticized as ‘needlessly brutal to servers’.” This sport is now emerging from its data-center basement origins and is set to enter the world stage at CloudFest 2024.</p><p> CloudFest provides a few details regarding the 2024 World Server Throwing Championship. This outdoor event in front of a live audience will welcome “up to 40 server-throwing athletes.” All genders and ability levels are welcome to participate as long as they desire to throw a server a great distance. Every athlete will get two measured attempts at server throwing and will hope to be placed in the top three so they can win a prize.</p><p> Though the sport is brutal by its very nature, it is good to see that participants at previous events always wear gloves. Some servers have very sharp edges. If you plan to attend, it might be wise to stand behind participants rather than to the left or right in case of server hurling misjudgment.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> It isn’t clear if there are 1U, 2U, and 4U divisions, or, dare we say it, 8U for the real heavy lifters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtmZvaBCUd7W2J88EkoF6b-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Server throwing athletes"                ></p><p> (Image credit: CloudFest)</p><p> If we had to place a bet on the winner’s nationality, it would probably be Dutch, as the country where the sport seems to have become established. We discovered that some of the WTSC partners have already promoted server throwing in Dutch events. The winner of a Dutch national championship event<a class="link"   href="https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/agenda/summer-bbq-dutch-cloud-community-2022/" >in 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> managed to fling a 10kg+ (22 pounds +) server 12.23 meters (over 40 feet).</p><p> We think there is plenty of room for improvement on the 2022 winning throw. Remember, the world record distance for throwing a 16-pound shot put is nearly 75 feet. For another comparison, in the Swedish sport of Stångstörtning, a roughly 57-pound log is tossed, with the world record distance being 32 feet. Much will depend on how well-tuned and trained the WSTC 2024 athletes are…</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> The CloudFest 2024 event occurs at Europa-park in Rust,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-submits-schematics-for-1nm-chip-fabs-in-germany-two-new-fabs-open-in-2027" >Germany <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , from March 18 to 24.

But you can also use it to translate a video, edit subtitles, create instant dubs&#x2F;voiceovers, make AI avatar videos and do so much more. It is a great option if you want a host of features to streamline your content creation process besides mere subtitle translation. Virbo is available on all major platforms, such as Online Browsers, PC&#x2F;Laptop, Android, and iOS devices.</p><h3 id="2-Microsoft-Translator"><a href="#2-Microsoft-Translator" class="headerlink" title="2.

It allows real time translated conversations across multiple devices and platforms. Another difference between Google and Microsoft Translator is that Microsoft’s Translator supports fewer languages. It’s only available for 103 languages, which is still more than big name translation services. A unique feature of Microsoft Translator is that it is also compatible with the MS Office suite. So you can use it with MS Excel, One Note, PowerPoint and Outlook. Lastly, this tool is particularly helpful with contextual understanding of a sentence.</p><h3 id="3-SubtitleBee"><a href="#3-SubtitleBee" class="headerlink" title="3. SubtitleBee"></a>3.

Moreover, it allows you to customize subtitles, edit and add cool font styles, colors, background details and orientation to create your unique projects.

Can I translate a full video with Google Translate?</strong></p><p> Of course, you can use Google Translate to get the translation of any length video. You will first have to transcribe the entire audio and then translate that transcript with the help of Google Video. You can use services like Virbo to add these translated subtitles to the original video.</p><p><strong>2. Does Google Translate really work for video translation?</strong></p><p> Well, Google Translate does not directly translate a video. You have to integrate it with other services like YouTube to get translation and then use Google Translate as a secondary tool to translate a video.</p><p><strong>3. Can I get a translated video in my native language?</strong></p><p> Yes, Google Translate supports almost 133 languages of the world. If your native language is spoken by a large population, chances are Google supports its translation to and from other languages. So, you can get a translated video in your native language.</p><p><strong>4. What languages does Google Translate support?</strong></p><p> Google Translate supports approximately 133 languages of the world at the moment. But it keeps on adding new language support every once in a while. You can get translations in all popular languages like English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, Hindi, Italian, Russian, Korean, etc.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> That’s pretty much all about translating a video using Google Translate. Tools like Google Translate and Wondershare Virbo make our world more connected than ever. They bridge boundaries and bring people together. But, don’t forget, if you are translating any copyrighted content with Google Translate, you may need permission. Translating copyrighted content without permission is still copyright infringement.

Get Alienware’s Gaming Desktop RTX 4070 Super + I7 CPU for Just $1,499 - Save $200</h2><p>With some amazing games released over the last year, there has been an increase in people looking to build a decent gaming PC over playing on a console where your graphical options are severely limited. However, getting your hands on a good gaming PC isn’t as easy as just picking up a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X console. It is also a lot more expensive, but the rewards are crisper graphics and higher framerates.</p><p> On sale at Dell is the redesigned<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8900246-12578053?sid=tomshardware-us-1312769239606935095&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/alienware-aurora-r16-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r16-desktop/useahctor16i17" >Alienware Aurora R16 Desktop Gaming PC available for $1,699 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — reduced by $200 from its $1,899 starting price. With a decent price-to-performance ratio for a prebuilt desktop gaming PC, the Alienware Aurora R16 features some of the latest hardware and is more than up to the challenge of playing your favorite game titles.</p><p> Sporting a much nicer case aesthetic (in my personal opinion) than the bulkier spaceship-looking cases from earlier generations, the Alienware Aurora R16 ups its cooling with more vents, better airflow, and a larger AIO cooler. This model features a 240mm radiator on the AIO liquid CPU cooler for keeping the Intel Core i7-14700F processor cool. This SKU of the Alienware Aurora R16 also comes with one of Nvidia’s mid-cycle GPU refresh cards - the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-super-review-boosted-clocks-and-core-counts-for-the-same-dollar599-as-the-vanilla-4070" >RTX 4070 Super <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - which is an improvement over the previous RTX 4070 by around 15% in performance.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cem58gxryoFToHGCZZcnHc-200-100.png"  title="Alienware Aurora R16 Desktop Gaming PC: now $1,699 at Dell CPU: Intel Core i7-14700F GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super 12GB RAM: 16 GB of DDR5 5600MHz SSD: 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe">Alienware Aurora R16 Desktop Gaming PC: now $1,699 at Dell CPU: Intel Core i7-14700F GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super 12GB RAM: 16 GB of DDR5 5600MHz SSD: 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8900246-12578053?sid=tomshardware-us-1022390770135691003&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/alienware-aurora-r16-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r16-desktop/useahctor16i17" >https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&amp;publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-8900246-12578053%3Fsid%3Dtomshardware-us-1022390770135691003%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdesktop-computers%2Falienware-aurora-r16-gaming-desktop%2Fspd%2Falienware-aurora-r16-desktop%2Fuseahctor16i17 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Alienware Aurora R16 Desktop Gaming PC:</strong> <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8900246-12578053?sid=tomshardware-us-3182932800519373910&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/alienware-aurora-r16-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r16-desktop/useahctor16i17"><strong>now $1,699 at Dell</strong></a>  (was $1,899)  </p><p> <em><strong>CPU: Intel Core i7-14700F</strong></em><br> <em><strong>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super 12GB</strong></em><br> <em><strong>RAM: 16 GB of DDR5 5600MHz</strong></em><br> <em><strong>SSD: 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe</strong></em></p><p> Stepping away from the more sci-fi case designs, the Alienware Aurora R16 goes for a more modest and subdued-looking case.

It also comes with some interesting if questionable design decisions. We’ll dive into that in a little bit, but the barebones kit includes just the case and a CPU cooler, starting at roughly $193 USD. A fully-specced version with a Ryzen 7 8700G will cost around $635 USD.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QjZwG9ogXk5eVbEARLkvGH-320-80.png"                      alt="The three colors of the ASRock DeckMate X600."                ></p><p> (Image credit: ASRock (via ITHome.com))</p><h2 id="ASRock-DeskMate-X600-Mini-PC-core-specifications"><a href="#ASRock-DeskMate-X600-Mini-PC-core-specifications" class="headerlink" title="ASRock DeskMate X600 Mini PC core specifications"></a>ASRock DeskMate X600 Mini PC core specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>Motherboard Chipset</strong> : AMD X600</li><li><strong>Motherboard Socket</strong> : Supports AM5 Ryzen 7000- and 8000-series CPUs up to 65W</li><li><strong>CPU Cooler</strong> : Includes low-profile 64mm CPU cooler</li><li><strong>Display I&#x2F;O</strong> : 2 DisplayPort 1.4 ports, 1 HDMI 2.1 port</li><li><strong>Front I&#x2F;O</strong> : 2 USB 3.2 ports, 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 USB Type-C port, 1 Audio Port</li><li><strong>Rear I&#x2F;O</strong> : 2 USB 3.2 ports, 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 2.5G Ethernet Port</li><li><strong>Supported RAM</strong> : Up to 7200 MT&#x2F;s and 192GB of DDR5 RAM, four slots</li><li><strong>Storage Options</strong> : Two NVMe slots (Gen 3 and Gen 4), one 2.5-inch mount for SATA</li><li><strong>Wireless Support</strong> : Optional Wi-Fi (depends on config)</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong> : 195 x 85 x 215 mm (roughly 3.5 liters)</li><li><strong>Default OS</strong> : Not Listed, most likely Windows 11</li><li><strong>Shell Colors</strong> : Obsidian Black, Starry Gray, and Moonlight Silver</li></ul><p> With the basics of the ASRock DeskMate X600 established, let’s focus on that top-mounted PCIe slot. Unlike the CWWK<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/chinese-mini-pc-offers-external-pcie-slot-and-an-interesting-inverted-u-form-factor" >Magic Computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the top-mounted PCIe slot here is intended for use with a PCIe riser cable and supports a separate full-bandwidth graphics card… but exactly how you’re expected to dock and power that external GPU isn’t quite clear. The DIY potential of powering a GPU with a separate PSU is always there, but then you’d need to short the power pins and that’s not exactly an elegant solution.  </p><p> And all of this beliest the fact that you’d then have a second PSU that might be as large as the Mini PC, plus cables, plus the honking RTX 4090 or whatever you want to stuff into the provided slot. That’s a lot of extra desk space for a “Mini PC” that seems to defeat the point of having a small system in the first place.  </p><p> Regardless, the maximum CPU spec that is a 65W TDP on socket AM5, which locks in the Ryzen 7 8700G as the best option right now, even if you plan on using an external GPU. Fortunately, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-7-8700g-cpu-review/4" >Ryzen 7 8700G is no slouch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in either iGPU_or_ discrete GPU performance, but once again, the intended eGPU use case here raises a lot of eyebrows. Of course, being socket AM5, we’d also expect the system to eventually get support for the upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-announces-zen-5-ryzen-9000-processors-launches-in-july-four-new-ryzen-9-7-and-5-processors-with-a-16-ipc-improvement" >AMD Zen 5 Ryzen 9000-series processors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .  </p><p> ASRock’s advertising is correct in that a proper PCIe 4.0 x16 link to an external GPU will provide far<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gpd-win-max-2-egpu-benchmarks" >better performance than Thunderbolt or even OCuLink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but this design decision unfortunately introduces plenty of its own problems. There aren’t exactly any PCIe riser cable-compatible eGPU docking stations, and if you’re going to have a bulky high-end graphics card, you’d probably want it properly supported and shielded from damage. A look at that top image makes us think it would be quite easy to accidentally knock over the GPU while the system is powered on, which could be a recipe for disaster.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-tech-for-instant-time-lapse-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Essential Tech for Instant Time-Lapse Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-how-to-angle-videos-for-improved-viewership/"><u>[New] How to Angle Videos for Improved Viewership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/gb-for-a-continuous-video-watched-daily-for-2024/"><u>GB for a Continuous Video Watched Daily for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-rescue-lost-messages-from-nubia-red-magic-8s-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>How to Rescue Lost Messages from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/inside-scoop-on-tesla-robot-rumors-estimated-costs-release-window-and-technical-details-unveiled/"><u>Inside Scoop on Tesla Robot: Rumors, Estimated Costs, Release Window, and Technical Details Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/masterclass-analyzing-the-updated-lg-bp550-for-2024/"><u>Masterclass Analyzing the Updated LG BP550 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/mastering-gadgets-and-components-with-toms-essential-hardware-wisdom/"><u>Mastering Gadgets and Components with Tom's Essential Hardware Wisdom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/navigating-the-digital-landscape-with-precision-the-ultimate-guide-by-tom-hardware/"><u>Navigating the Digital Landscape with Precision: The Ultimate Guide by Tom Hardware</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/ultimate-review-of-mophie-powerstation-ac-expensive-yet-incredibly-handy/"><u>Ultimate Review of Mophie PowerStation AC: Expensive Yet Incredibly Handy</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

In the recent wave of development,<strong>deepfake streamers</strong> have emerged as a way of replicating people in videos. Creators are also using<strong>deepfake live streams</strong> to engage viewers with avatars that look just like their favorite celebs. However, deepfake streams often encounter attacks and issues that may question their authenticity. In this article, we look at some of the hacks creators can use to beat deepfake attacks.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Deepfake-Scandals"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Deepfake-Scandals" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Deepfake Scandals?"></a>Part 1: What is Deepfake Scandals?</h2><p> Deepfake scandals involve incidents when media is manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI) in unethical or harmful ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/5-must-know-hacks-to-beat-deepfake-attacks-streamer-survival-guide-1.jpg"                      alt="deepface scandals"                ></p><p>Some of the issues included in the Deepfake scandals include:</p><ol><li><strong>Misinformation and Disinformation:</strong> Creation of misleading and false videos or audio recordings of public figures, which helps to sway public opinion and influence elections.</li><li><strong>Financial Fraud:</strong> Impersonating someone to gain access to their financial accounts and other personal information.</li><li><strong>Nonconsensual Deepfake Pornography:</strong> Superimposing an individual’s face or body onto another’s in sexually explicit content without their consent.</li><li><strong>Cyberbullying and harassment:</strong> Creating humiliating or embarrassing videos of an individual to harass or cyberbully them.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Must-read-Tips-for-Deepfake-Streamers"><a href="#Part-2-Must-read-Tips-for-Deepfake-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-read Tips for Deepfake Streamers"></a>Part 2: Must-read Tips for Deepfake Streamers</h2><p> The rise of deepfake content has caught the eyes of many regulatory agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The major concern is the use of deepfakes for crimes like blackmail, extortion, and harassment. With several scandals also pegged to deepfake, streamers need to be conscious of how they use this technology. Here are 5 must-read pieces of advice concerning deepfakes.</p><h3 id="1-Choose-Your-Content-Wisely"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Content-Wisely" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose Your Content Wisely"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Choose Your Content Wisely</strong></h3><p> Although the power of deepfakes is undeniable, creatives can overcome it by choosing content wisely. To be on the safe side, avoid content that treads on sensitive ground. Stay away from topics that spread misinformation, and avoid engaging in malicious humor or issues that involve impersonating real people without their consent. You may be considering using fictional narratives, original characters, or transformative works that push the boundaries of storytelling. Try to be more creative and imaginative in your work while staying within the ethical frameworks.</p><h3 id="2-Be-Transparent-in-Your-Work"><a href="#2-Be-Transparent-in-Your-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. Be Transparent in Your Work"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Be Transparent in Your Work</strong></h3><p> Streamers are often carried away by the buzz or the need to stay in the spotlight. However, being honest and transparent will help you stay authentic with your audience. Right from the onset, try to be as upfront with your views as possible about the use of deepfakes. By being open about your creative journey, you will be enhancing rather than spoiling the magic.</p><p> The way you represent deepfakes to your audience means everything. Announce your personas clearly and explain the technology behind the creation. Use the opportunity to build trust with your audience and engage them in intriguing conversations about the nature of identity and digital representations. Doing so can also help spark more interest among the audience as they realize that they are interacting with a meticulously crafted avatar and not a celebrity clone.</p><h3 id="3-Label-and-Contextualize"><a href="#3-Label-and-Contextualize" class="headerlink" title="3. Label and Contextualize"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Label and Contextualize</strong></h3><p> When you are using deepfakes for streaming, treat your viewer like an intelligent companion. Avoid the mistake of seeing them as gullible marks. Make sure your content is clearly labeled as deepfake through titles, overlays, or disclaimers in your stream. Show that you care about your audience and you do not want to leave them guessing. Explain the purpose behind your chosen person and the creative choices that you have made.</p><h3 id="4-Prioritize-Respect-Over-Reach"><a href="#4-Prioritize-Respect-Over-Reach" class="headerlink" title="4. Prioritize Respect Over Reach"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Prioritize Respect Over Reach</strong></h3><p> Deepfakes allow you to instantly explore fame and what people think of your avatar. However, avoid being carried away by the fame and being swayed to the unethical side. Steer clear of impersonation that can lead to reputational damage or harm vulnerable groups. Even if your avatar is just a fictional character, it still deserves ethical treatment. If it engaged in potential offensive behavior, make sure it is within the confines of your established narrative.</p><h3 id="5-Embrace-the-Collaborative-Spirit"><a href="#5-Embrace-the-Collaborative-Spirit" class="headerlink" title="5. Embrace the Collaborative Spirit"></a><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Embrace the Collaborative Spirit</strong></h3><p> Deepfake streamlining has great potential for community building. You can easily collaborate with other creators by engaging in open discussions and encouraging responsible use of the technology. Working together with other creators also helps you to share knowledge and troubleshoot challenges together. You also get to elevate your content while contributing to a healthier and more responsible deepfake ecosystem.</p><h2 id="Bonus-A-Safe-Choice-for-Live-Streaming-Virbo-Live"><a href="#Bonus-A-Safe-Choice-for-Live-Streaming-Virbo-Live" class="headerlink" title="Bonus - A Safe Choice for Live Streaming: Virbo Live"></a>Bonus - A Safe Choice for Live Streaming: Virbo Live</h2><p> Whether you are a content creator or a brand, you can benefit from the power of AI in your content.

Then, click the<strong>Voicebox</strong> tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-3.jpg"                      alt="choose a voice effect on voicemod ai"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If the voice is working, head to the application or browser tab where you want to apply the voice effect to start streaming. That’s it!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Real-User-Experience"><a href="#Part-III-Real-User-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Part III. Real User Experience"></a>Part III. Real User Experience</h2><p> So, what was our user experience with<strong>AI Voicemod</strong> ? To be honest, Voicemod is one of the best if not the best, voice modulator programs. We were impressed by how easily it picks up sounds on our microphone. The range of voice effects and customization options is also impressive, to say the least. And yes, the platform itself looks stylish and modern.</p><p> But this program’s main drawback comes from its major strength. Although Voicemod is a feature-rich program, beginners might feel intimidated at first. You may need to follow the developer’s guide to connect your microphone appropriately and customize the sound settings. Overall, Voicemod isn’t for green hands, although it’s fun to use once you get the hang of it.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-Pricing-and-Plans"><a href="#Part-IV-Pricing-and-Plans" class="headerlink" title="Part IV. Pricing and Plans"></a>Part IV. Pricing and Plans</h2><p> Although Voicemod is free, you must upgrade to the Pro version to unlock all the voice effects and capabilities. Thankfully, the Voicemod subscription plan is one of the most competitive. You can opt for the One-Time Payment at**$59.00** , although the program often has<strong>50% off</strong> for new installations. You can also choose the Annual plan of**$23.88** or the 3-month plan of**$11.97** .</p><p>Below are some of the advantages you’ll get with Voicemod Pro:</p><ul><li>Design your unique voices from scratch with VoiceLab.</li><li>Unlimited MP3 and WAV audio uploads.</li><li>Complete Voicebox with 80+ pre-made voice effects.</li><li>Receive new voices and themed soundboards every month.</li><li>Unlock all AI voice filters.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-4.jpg"                      alt="voicemod ai pricing"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-Try-the-Best-Alternative-to-Voicemod-AI-Virbo"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-Try-the-Best-Alternative-to-Voicemod-AI-Virbo" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: Try the Best Alternative to Voicemod AI - Virbo"></a>Bonus Tips: Try the Best Alternative to Voicemod AI - Virbo</h2><p> Voicemod might stand out as one of the best voice-changing software around.

If you are a content creator, translating English videos to Arabic presents an opportunity to reach such a wide audience. In this article, we will present one such tool that can help you <strong>translate video to Arabic</strong> with ease.

Common Challenges In Translating English Videos Into Arabic"></a>Part 1. Common Challenges In Translating English Videos Into Arabic</h2><p> Below are some common challenges you face when you want to translate videos to Arabic.</p><h4 id="Lack-of-Semantic-Nuances"><a href="#Lack-of-Semantic-Nuances" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Semantic Nuances"></a>Lack of Semantic Nuances</h4><p> Arabic is a very rich language with semantic nuances. As it exhibits a distinct linguistic structure, taking care of linguistic and cultural nuances is the main challenge in accurately capturing the meaning during translation.</p><h4 id="Translating-Idiomatic-Expressions"><a href="#Translating-Idiomatic-Expressions" class="headerlink" title="Translating Idiomatic Expressions"></a>Translating Idiomatic Expressions</h4><p> Translating Arabic idioms, colloquialisms, and culturally specific expressions is difficult as these may not have direct or indirect equivalents in (say, for example) English. AI tools, in particular fail to accurately translate such sentences.</p><h4 id="Considering-Sentence-Structure-Variations"><a href="#Considering-Sentence-Structure-Variations" class="headerlink" title="Considering Sentence Structure Variations"></a>Considering Sentence Structure Variations</h4><p> Maintaining coherence and natural flow is essential for effective communication. Arabic follows a very different sentence structure, complicating the translation process. For example, it is written from right to left, therefore, the translation will be read in the opposite direction.</p><h4 id="Translating-Gender-and-Formality"><a href="#Translating-Gender-and-Formality" class="headerlink" title="Translating Gender and Formality"></a>Translating Gender and Formality</h4><p> Arabic includes gender-specific pronouns and formal&#x2F;informal distinctions, whereas English is more neutral towards gender. Ensuring appropriate gender and formality in translations is crucial for cultural sensitivity.</p><h4 id="Lack-of-Technical-Vocabulary"><a href="#Lack-of-Technical-Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Technical Vocabulary"></a>Lack of Technical Vocabulary</h4><p> Technical terms may lack direct equivalents in Arabic. For example, the term “Artificial Intelligence” has no equivalent translation in Arabic. Not all AI tools will translate these terms to accurately convey the meaning. Therefore, we recommend only the best.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tool-for-Translating-Videos-Into-Arabic"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tool-for-Translating-Videos-Into-Arabic" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="59-for-Musical-Mastery-Embrace-the-World-of-Open-Source-with-Tulip’s-MicroPython-Driven-Computer-Designed-for-Musicians"><a href="#59-for-Musical-Mastery-Embrace-the-World-of-Open-Source-with-Tulip’s-MicroPython-Driven-Computer-Designed-for-Musicians" class="headerlink" title="$59 for Musical Mastery: Embrace the World of Open Source with Tulip’s MicroPython-Driven Computer Designed for Musicians"></a>$59 for Musical Mastery: Embrace the World of Open Source with Tulip’s MicroPython-Driven Computer Designed for Musicians</h2><p>For just $59, musicians now have a new option for a purpose-built musical computer with a touchscreen and music synthesizer— meet the<a class="link"   href="https://tulip.computer/" >Tulip Creative Computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a FOSS (Free and Open Source) project available as a pre-made purchase in free software form for existing PCs and Macs, or even fully buildable at home to those with the resources and know-how to get it done.</p><p> A simple dual-core powers the Tulip PC, 250 MHz ESP32-S3 with 8.5 MB of RAM and 32 MB of storage connected to a 7-inch, 30 Hz IPS touchscreen running at a 1024 x 600 resolution. These specs are pretty light by modern standards, but they seem sensible for a device tailored purely to making or playing music with attached keyboards, MIDI devices, and speakers.</p><p> Per the official page, the primary purpose of the Tulip computer is to make and play music. Still, its support for Python programming also makes it capable of displaying a variety of sprites, PNGs, backgrounds, etc— which means even lightweight games should be makeable or playable on the device. There’s no real multimedia or web browsing functionality here besides. However, Tulip also has access to an exclusive BBS Tulip WORLD system for sharing music files and chatting with other users.</p><p> Tulip, a musical computer based on Micropython - YouTube <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/1lYFjQp7Xrw/maxresdefault.jpg"                      alt="Tulip, a musical computer based on Micropython - YouTube"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/1lYFjQp7Xrw" >Watch On <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The synthesizer at the heart of Tulip is the AMY (Addictive Music synthesizer librarY), another FOSS project made to be integrated across “almost any program, architecture, or microcontroller” and usable as an FM synthesizer, analog-type synthesizer, drum machine, or even a breakpoint synthesizer. AMY is also used by the FOSS mesh synthesizer project Alles (think FOSS wireless speaker mesh solution), which Tulip Creative Computers also supports.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> For musicians comfortable with Python or FOSS hardware and software solutions, the Tulip project seems like a nifty piece of purpose-built hardware (or software if you prefer not to buy or build anything), ideal for essential music production or simple coding projects.</p><p> When it comes to specialized hardware like this (or retro PC hardware in general), “necessity is the mother of invention” and “limitations foster creativity.” It would be interesting to see some rudimentary arcade or DOS game ports on this machine— a dual-core 250 MHz microcontroller may not sound like a lot today, but in the 80s, even 16 MHz was considered cutting-edge.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-make-a-game-streaming-video-with-ai-portrait/"><u>[Updated] How to Make a Game Streaming Video With AI Portrait</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-path-to-igtv-fame-5-growth-strategies-explored/"><u>2024 Approved Navigating the Path to IGTV Fame 5 Growth Strategies Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/enhance-audio-visual-fidelity-use-av1-on-youtube/"><u>Enhance Audio-Visual Fidelity Use AV1 on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/expert-guide-screen-capture-on-windows-8-devices-for-2024/"><u>Expert Guide Screen Capture on Windows 8 Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/free-downloadable-movie-player-software-for-playstation-portable-and-ps4-convert-videos-effortlessly/"><u>Free Downloadable Movie Player Software for PlayStation Portable and PS4 - Convert Videos Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/harness-the-potential-of-a-full-size-gpu-asrocks-new-mini-pc-deskmate-x6-600-for-china-only-193-usd/"><u>Harness the Potential of a Full-Size GPU: ASRock's New Mini PC - DeskMate X6 600 for China, Only $193 USD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Samsung Galaxy S24+?
