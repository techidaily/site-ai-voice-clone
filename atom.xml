    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Translate-Video-From-English-to-Arabic-with-Ease"><a href="#Translate-Video-From-English-to-Arabic-with-Ease" class="headerlink" title="Translate Video From English to Arabic with Ease"></a>Translate Video From English to Arabic with Ease</h2><p> Arabic is the sixth most spoken (and understood) language in the world. According to Wikipedia, there are approximately 422 million Arabic speakers (native &amp; non-native). If you are a content creator, translating English videos to Arabic presents an opportunity to reach such a wide audience. In this article, we will present one such tool that can help you <strong>translate video to Arabic</strong> with ease. We will also discuss common challenges in translating videos to Arabic and how our recommendation overcomes them. So, without further ado, let’s dive in.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Challenges-In-Translating-English-Videos-Into-Arabic"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Challenges-In-Translating-English-Videos-Into-Arabic" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Common Challenges In Translating English Videos Into Arabic"></a>Part 1. Common Challenges In Translating English Videos Into Arabic</h2><p> Below are some common challenges you face when you want to translate videos to Arabic.</p><h4 id="Lack-of-Semantic-Nuances"><a href="#Lack-of-Semantic-Nuances" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Semantic Nuances"></a>Lack of Semantic Nuances</h4><p> Arabic is a very rich language with semantic nuances. As it exhibits a distinct linguistic structure, taking care of linguistic and cultural nuances is the main challenge in accurately capturing the meaning during translation.</p><h4 id="Translating-Idiomatic-Expressions"><a href="#Translating-Idiomatic-Expressions" class="headerlink" title="Translating Idiomatic Expressions"></a>Translating Idiomatic Expressions</h4><p> Translating Arabic idioms, colloquialisms, and culturally specific expressions is difficult as these may not have direct or indirect equivalents in (say, for example) English. AI tools, in particular fail to accurately translate such sentences.</p><h4 id="Considering-Sentence-Structure-Variations"><a href="#Considering-Sentence-Structure-Variations" class="headerlink" title="Considering Sentence Structure Variations"></a>Considering Sentence Structure Variations</h4><p> Maintaining coherence and natural flow is essential for effective communication. Arabic follows a very different sentence structure, complicating the translation process. For example, it is written from right to left, therefore, the translation will be read in the opposite direction.</p><h4 id="Translating-Gender-and-Formality"><a href="#Translating-Gender-and-Formality" class="headerlink" title="Translating Gender and Formality"></a>Translating Gender and Formality</h4><p> Arabic includes gender-specific pronouns and formal&#x2F;informal distinctions, whereas English is more neutral towards gender. Ensuring appropriate gender and formality in translations is crucial for cultural sensitivity.</p><h4 id="Lack-of-Technical-Vocabulary"><a href="#Lack-of-Technical-Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Technical Vocabulary"></a>Lack of Technical Vocabulary</h4><p> Technical terms may lack direct equivalents in Arabic. For example, the term “Artificial Intelligence” has no equivalent translation in Arabic. Not all AI tools will translate these terms to accurately convey the meaning. Therefore, we recommend only the best.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tool-for-Translating-Videos-Into-Arabic"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tool-for-Translating-Videos-Into-Arabic" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What is an AI headshot generator?"></a>Part 1. What is an AI headshot generator?</h2><p>An AI headshot generator is a software or application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to create realistic and high-quality headshot images of individuals. These generators use deep learning techniques to produce lifelike portraits from scratch, often employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).</p><p>Users typically provide input to the AI headshot generator, such as specifying certain attributes or characteristics they want in the generated image, like age, gender, ethnicity, facial expression, and more. The AI then processes this input and generates a corresponding headshot that matches the desired criteria.</p><p>These generators can be used for various purposes, including creating profile pictures, avatars, character images for games or storytelling, and even for artistic or creative projects. It’s worth noting that while these generators can produce impressive results, they might sometimes unintentionally perpetuate certain biases present in the training data, which is an important consideration when using such tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-AI-created-headshots-be-used-in-professional-occasion"><a href="#Part-2-Can-AI-created-headshots-be-used-in-professional-occasion" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What is an AI headshot generator?"></a>Part 1. What is an AI headshot generator?</h2><p>An AI headshot generator is a software or application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to create realistic and high-quality headshot images of individuals. These generators use deep learning techniques to produce lifelike portraits from scratch, often employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).</p><p>Users typically provide input to the AI headshot generator, such as specifying certain attributes or characteristics they want in the generated image, like age, gender, ethnicity, facial expression, and more. The AI then processes this input and generates a corresponding headshot that matches the desired criteria.</p><p>These generators can be used for various purposes, including creating profile pictures, avatars, character images for games or storytelling, and even for artistic or creative projects. It’s worth noting that while these generators can produce impressive results, they might sometimes unintentionally perpetuate certain biases present in the training data, which is an important consideration when using such tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Can-AI-created-headshots-be-used-in-professional-occasion-1"><a href="#Part-2-Can-AI-created-headshots-be-used-in-professional-occasion-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The AtomMan G7 Pt, however, is somewhere in-between as a Mini PC featuring mobile processors. For the rest of the specs check out the table below.</p><p> Swipe to scroll horizontally</p><table><thead><tr><th>Processor</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX Processor, 16C&#x2F;32T (64M Cache, up to 5.4 GHz)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPU</td><td>AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT (GDDR6 8G)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>DDR5-5200 Dual channel (SODIMM Slots×2, Max 96GB)</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>M.2 2280 PCIe5.0 SSD ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Storage Expansion</td><td>M.2 2280 PCIe4.0 SSD ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Connectivity</td><td>M.2 2230 Wi-Fi support (Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Video Output</td><td>HDMI 2.1 ×1；DisplayPort 2.0 ×1；USB-C ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Audio Output</td><td>HDMI 2.1 ×1；DisplayPort 2.0 ×1；3.5mm Combo Jack ×1；Line out ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Peripherals Interface</td><td>RJ45 2.5G Ethernet Port×1 USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A Port ×1(In Front) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A Port ×3(In Back) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C Port ×1(In Front, Data Only) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C Port ×1(In Back, Alt Data and DP) HDMI ×1 DisplayPort ×1 3.5mm Combo Jack ×1 Line out ×1 Mic in ×1 Clear CMOS ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>DC 19V (adapter included)</td></tr><tr><td>System</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCXcTW8u5XFwpHJ2k5ueD6-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan G7 Pt"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> The AMD Dragon Range CPU and RX7600M XT may not be the newest or most powerful AMD combo a PC maker could assemble in mid-2024. Nevertheless, they should do a pretty good job delivering a capable mini gaming system experience, as long as user ambitions for higher resolutions (like 4K) and raytracing are kept in check.</p><p> Another thing that needs to be carefully kept in check in a mini system is cooling. Minisforum touts the capabilities of its Cold Wave Ultra cooling system, which uses “a vertical single heat pipe with dual air inlets in series and dual-sided quad fans.” Complementing the processor cooling, it has also fitted “an enhanced DDR&#x2F;SSD active cooler and dual liquid metal 8-heat pipe separated link.” The firm claims the cooling fitted into the AtomMan G7 Pt can cope with up to 205W, without fan noise breaching 45dB.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Other aspects of the interior specs worth commenting on are the device’s easy upgrades with twin DDR5-5200 SODOMM slots for up to 96GB RAM. Also, it has two M.2 storage slots (PCIe5.0 and PCIe4.0), and a socketed wireless card.</p><p> Connectivity seems pretty good for such a small box. As well as Wi-Fi 7 there is a 2.5G Ethernet port, and you can connect up to three 4K monitors at once (HDMI, DP, and USB-C). Six USB ports are available in total, with all being USB 3.2 Gen2 rated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vH5yUKbtEt5tHuJMtPYk5-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan G7 Pt"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> One of the bigger changes we have seen added to the AtomMan G7 Pt since its name was switched from the HX200G is the provision of dual RGB backlighting panels. The example logo scrawl provides a prime example of beauty being in the eye of the beholder.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> Pricing for the AtomMan G7 Pt hasn’t been divulged, though we have written back to Minisforum for some pricing details.

Affordable Intel I5, GTX 4060 NZXT Gaming PC at $59&#x2F;Month or Indulge in Luxury with Core I7 and RTX 4070 Ti for $169 a Month</h2><p>NZXT has initiated a new subscription plan —<a class="link"   href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=755373&u=4338022&m=60525&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https://silver-cuisine.pxf.io/nlgolx" >NZXT Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — that enables gamers to rent a pre-built NZXT gaming system for a monthly fee. With NZXT Flex, customers can rent a gaming PC for as little as $59 monthly with guaranteed component upgrades every two years.</p><p> NZXT Flex has three subscription tiers revolving around NZXT’s pre-existing Player pre-built gaming PCs. The Player: One, featuring a Core i5-14400F,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review-asus-dual" >RTX 4060 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and H5 Flow case, is the cheapest offering with NZXT’s subscription service that can be rented for $59 monthly. The Player: Two is the mid-range offering featuring a Ryzen 5 5600X, RTX 4070 Super, and H5 Elite case, which can be rented for $119 monthly. The Player: Three is the most potent system users can rent from NZXT, featuring a Core i7-13700KF, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and H7 Flow chassis for $169 monthly.</p><p> Additional perks of the Flex subscription service include a lifetime warranty and 24&#x2F;7 support. Customers who keep their systems long enough will also receive “guaranteed” PC upgrades every two years to keep their systems up to date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHzgMBCkYAYYHmc6iPETgK-320-80.png"                      alt="NZXT Flex Subscription Tiers"                ></p><p>(Image credit: NZXT)</p><p> Flex was made to improve PC gaming accessibility. According to Bryan De Zayas, NZXT’s Head of Marketing: “At NZXT, we believe everyone should be able to play the games they love,” “In the past, that meant buying a pre-built PC or building your own. Our new Flex subscription service offers gamers more flexibility and choice, so they can focus on what really matters – playing the games they love.” NZXT’s subscription service gives gamers access to a modern gaming PC when they otherwise couldn’t afford one.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> The only caveat with NZXT Flex is that it starts to lose its value over a long period — for customers who plan to rent their machines for over two years. The Player: One, for instance, can be bought for approximately $1,054.00 with virtually the same specs as the rentable version for $59 a month, translating into almost 18 months before you’ve spent enough money to buy the system outright (approximately).

Google, being a leader in technological innovation, has introduced several tools that make communication more seamless. Most of us are already familiar with one such tool, Google Translate. After all, it’s the go-to text translation option for many people. But can it be used for translating a video? We will answer this question in detail below. So, let’s dive into the world of<strong>Google Translate Video</strong> .</p><h2 id="Part-1-Benefits-of-Using-Google-Translate-for-Video-Translation"><a href="#Part-1-Benefits-of-Using-Google-Translate-for-Video-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Benefits of Using Google Translate for Video Translation"></a>Part 1: Benefits of Using Google Translate for Video Translation</h2><p> Below are some of the biggest benefits of using Google Translate for translating videos:</p><p><strong>1.

You can use it for hour-long videos and this service won’t charge you a dime. This can help you save some bucks on hiring professional translation services.</p><p><strong>2. Google Translate Supports Almost All Languages</strong></p><p> That’s correct. Google Translate currently supports 133 languages of the world. That means with the help of Google Translate you can reach a much wider global language than any other service. You can easily translate your tutorials, how-to guides, podcasts, social media posts, scripts etc to reach as many people as possible.</p><p><strong>3. Google Translate Works In Real Time</strong></p><p> Google Translate provides instant translations. You don’t have to wait for the AI to understand the language first and then provide accurate translations. So,<strong>Google Translate video</strong> can be a lifesaver for content creators who are always on the go and need instant access to translations for their content.</p><p><strong>4. Google Translate Needs No Installation or Sign Up</strong></p><p> Most translation tools require either a sign up or software installation, Google Translation is straightforward to use. Simply copy your content and paste it into the translation window. Google Translate will instantly pick up the language to give you the translation. It’s that simple.</p><p><strong>5. Google Translate Also Works Offline</strong></p><p> The biggest benefit of Google Translate is uninterrupted service. You can download Google Translate app on your mobile phones and translate content offline. It can be particularly beneficial for content creators who don’t always have an internet connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Step-Guidance-How-To-Get-Google-Translate-to-Translate-A-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Step-Guidance-How-To-Get-Google-Translate-to-Translate-A-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step Guidance: How To Get Google Translate to Translate A Video"></a>Part 2: Step Guidance: How To Get Google Translate to Translate A Video</h2><p> If you are a beginner the following steps may seem a bit of work, but let me assure you, they are very straightforward.

What is The Breakdown of a Perfect Translated Document?</h2><p> A factor to consider when<strong>translating YouTube videos into text</strong> is precise translation. The flawless interpretation of speech is important to maintain the essence of video. While translating, it should keep the style, intent, cultural and ethical content norms. This section will elaborate on the factors that form the basis of a good, translated document:</p><ol><li><strong>Precision and Uniformity:</strong>  There are no grammatical or factual errors in the translation. The tool must maintain the context and essence of the content. The translation should be natural while avoiding any awkward encounters. Moreover, the tone and writing style should be consistent throughout the document.</li><li><strong>Cultural Boundaries:</strong>  The tone or words must not violate cultural norms and ethics. Some cultures are sensitive to specific content, while to some, it is no big deal. Hence, the translator should have background information on target cultures.</li><li><strong>Relevant Jargon and Expressions:</strong>  Vast training data helps comprehend the content better. This involves the use of industry-specific jargon and terminologies. In addition, idiomatic expressions also elevate content and attract target audience.</li><li><strong>Proofread and Finalized:</strong>  It can bring clarity through well-structured and well-managed sentences. Another way of maintaining clarity is by correcting grammatical and spelling errors. The translated content must be proofread and well-formatted to rule out any mistakes. Using headings, sub-headings, bullet points, and formatting elements does the trick.</li><li><strong>Uphold Local Standards:</strong>  To relate with the audience, adopting the local language is important. The translator must gather some insights into regional or cultural norms. This will help in the translation of content in an effective and preferred way.</li><li><strong>Legal and Ethical Boundaries:</strong>  Upholding legal and ethical boundaries is important in all documents. If the video contains any medical records, it is essential to keep them confidential. In case of sensitive information, a translator must follow legal and ethical considerations.</li><li><strong>Requirements and Review:</strong>  To achieve perfection, try finding a native translator for proofreading. The translator should follow any specific instructions provided by the client. This covers word count, file format, or reference materials. Besides, deadlines should be followed in handling translation to clients. Through the process, the translator must uphold communication with the client.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-What-Should-a-Good-Video-to-Text-Converter-Contain"><a href="#Part-2-What-Should-a-Good-Video-to-Text-Converter-Contain" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Live Stream to Instagram With an RTMP?"></a>Part 2. How To Live Stream to Instagram With an RTMP?</h2><p> Setting high-quality live streams encourages people to tune into your broadcast. For this purpose, you need a seamless encoder like <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

To solve this query, you need an effective solution.</p><p> Therefore, the following steps guide streaming on Instagram with an RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol). You will also learn how to set the required parameters in this comprehensive guide:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Start with downloading and launching OBS Studio on your PC. The first thing to do is set up vertical camera dimensions for<strong>RTMP Instagram live</strong> streaming. To access the settings window, hit the “Settings” option in the “Controls” panel.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-stream-to-instagram-with-rtmp-2.jpg"                      alt="proceed to settings in obs"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Look for the “Video” tab in the “Settings” window that opens. After that, enter “1080x1920” in the “Base (Canvas) Resolution” bar. Similarly, add a “1080x1920” value in the “Output (Scaled) Resolution” bar to set a 9:16 aspect ratio for vertical display. Then, hit the “OK” button to apply these changes to your Instagram streams.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-stream-to-instagram-with-rtmp-3.jpg"                      alt="set canvas resolution"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> After that, you need to add external sources to the scene. Click on the “+” icon in the “Scenes” panel or rename the scene. Once the scene is created, hit the “+” icon of the “Sources” panel. Then, select the “Video Capture Device” option from the menu and rename the device to your liking. After that, choose the video capture device from the “Device” dropdown and hit the “OK” option. Similarly, you can select the “Audio Input Capture” option to introduce an audio device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-stream-to-instagram-with-rtmp-4.jpg"                      alt="add a video capturing device"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> To add text overlays on your stream, hit the “+” icon again in the “Sources” panel. Choose the “Text (GDI+)” option and rename your overlay. On the next window, insert your text in the “Text” box. Then, click the “Select Font” button and choose your required font style and size. Additionally, you can change font color, opacity, alignment, background, and more. After customizing the text, hit the “OK” button to save the overlay in the sources section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-stream-to-instagram-with-rtmp-5.jpg"                      alt="set up text properties"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Afterward, select the “Stream” option in the settings window of OBS Studio. Set the “Service” to “Custom” from the dropdown.

Each is crucial in its own right when it comes to<strong>Tamil language translate to English</strong> :</p><h3 id="Meaning"><a href="#Meaning" class="headerlink" title="Meaning"></a>Meaning</h3><p> Translating is converting the meaning of spoken words or written text from one language to another, like English convert to Tamil meaning. It ensures that the essence and intent remain intact. Transcribing focuses on converting spoken words into written text. It captures the dialogue or narration without considering the nuances of translation.</p><h3 id="Context"><a href="#Context" class="headerlink" title="Context"></a>Context</h3><p> Translation takes into account the broader context of the content. It often factors in cultural references and idiomatic expressions. It also takes into account societal norms to convey the message. Transcription deals with capturing the spoken words. It doesn’t delve into the context or cultural nuances.</p><h3 id="Nuances"><a href="#Nuances" class="headerlink" title="Nuances"></a>Nuances</h3><p> Translation requires knowing both languages involved. It allows you to convey the nuances of the original content. Transcription focuses more on capturing the spoken words.

Guidelines for Creating Accurate Spanish Translation"></a>Part 3. Guidelines for Creating Accurate Spanish Translation</h2><h5 id="01-of-10-Understand-the-Context"><a href="#01-of-10-Understand-the-Context" class="headerlink" title="01 of 10 Understand the Context"></a><strong>01</strong> of 10 Understand the Context</h5><p> Most AI translation tools lack contextual understanding. Make sure the translated text provides complete sentences or phrases without skipping any important detail.</p><h5 id="02-of-10-Check-the-Formality"><a href="#02-of-10-Check-the-Formality" class="headerlink" title="02 of 10 Check the Formality"></a><strong>02</strong> of 10 Check the Formality</h5><p> Spanish has formal and informal forms of address. Make sure the Spanish to English video translation tool reflects the appropriate level of formality based on the context and relationship between the conversing parties.</p><h5 id="03-of-10-Be-Mindful-of-Idioms"><a href="#03-of-10-Be-Mindful-of-Idioms" class="headerlink" title="03 of 10 Be Mindful of Idioms"></a><strong>03</strong> of 10 Be Mindful of Idioms</h5><p> Idiomatic expressions in Spanish don’t always have direct equivalents in English. AI tools may struggle with these, so be ready to simplify or rephrase to convey the intended message accurately.</p><h5 id="04-of-10-Review-Regional-Variations"><a href="#04-of-10-Review-Regional-Variations" class="headerlink" title="04 of 10 Review Regional Variations"></a><strong>04</strong> of 10 Review Regional Variations</h5><p> Spanish varies across regions. For instance, Spanish in Latin America is vastly different from Spanish in Spain. Therefore, you should consider the target audience’s region and adjust translations accordingly, especially for colloquialisms and regional vocabulary.</p><h5 id="05-of-10-Verify-Technical-Terms"><a href="#05-of-10-Verify-Technical-Terms" class="headerlink" title="05 of 10 Verify Technical Terms"></a><strong>05</strong> of 10 Verify Technical Terms</h5><p> For specialized or technical content, verify that the Spanish video translator understands and translates industry-specific terms correctly. You can provide additional context in the preview if needed.</p><h5 id="06-of-10-Double-Check-Tenses"><a href="#06-of-10-Double-Check-Tenses" class="headerlink" title="06 of 10 Double-Check Tenses"></a><strong>06</strong> of 10 Double-Check Tenses</h5><p> Spanish and English express time differently. Ensure the AI captures the correct tense, especially in complex sentences, to convey the intended temporal meaning accurately.</p><h5 id="07-of-10-Handle-Gender-Sensitively"><a href="#07-of-10-Handle-Gender-Sensitively" class="headerlink" title="07 of 10 Handle Gender Sensitively"></a><strong>07</strong> of 10 Handle Gender Sensitively</h5><p> Spanish had a binary (masculine&#x2F;feminine) gender system only, while US English has multiple. Ensure the AI translates gender-sensitive terms appropriately and consistently throughout the text.</p><h5 id="08-of-10-Consider-Sentence-Structure"><a href="#08-of-10-Consider-Sentence-Structure" class="headerlink" title="08 of 10 Consider Sentence Structure"></a><strong>08</strong> of 10 Consider Sentence Structure</h5><p> Spanish and English have different sentence structures. Verify that the translated text maintains clarity and coherence while respecting the syntactic rules of the target language.</p><h5 id="09-of-10-Proofread-and-Edit"><a href="#09-of-10-Proofread-and-Edit" class="headerlink" title="09 of 10 Proofread and Edit"></a><strong>09</strong> of 10 Proofread and Edit</h5><p> AI tools may not catch nuanced errors. So, if you want to translate voice&#x2F;videos from Spanish into any language, proofread the translated text. Check for grammatical accuracy, style, and overall fluency. Make necessary edits to enhance readability.</p><h5 id="10-of-10-Add-Human-Touch"><a href="#10-of-10-Add-Human-Touch" class="headerlink" title="10 of 10 Add Human Touch"></a><strong>10</strong> of 10 Add Human Touch</h5><p> While AI tools are a great help for translation, they lack the nuanced understanding that humans possess. For critical or sensitive content, consider reviewing the AI-generated translations by a human translator to ensure accuracy and cultural appropriateness</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Breaking language barriers in audio&#x2F;video content is now more accessible than ever.

In contrast, translating videos means promoting your content and making it available to all. Remember that only 20% of the world’s population speaks English, but 100 million people watch video content. Thus, content creators <strong>translate live videos</strong> to English to rank their content for wider accessibility.</p><p> According to research, 89% of videos are viewed when they are properly translated. If you are looking for a language translator, read this article and make it possible. There, you will find a live video language translator that matches your needs. Besides, this article will show some characteristics of a good, translated video.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Ethical-Boundaries-of-Translating-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Ethical-Boundaries-of-Translating-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Are the Ethical Boundaries of Translating Videos?"></a>Part 1. What Are the Ethical Boundaries of Translating Videos?</h2><p> Taking care of ethical boundaries means to maintain the integrity of the content. It’s the fundamental principle while translating videos into another language. In this way, you can build trust and credibility among viewers. Moreover, your translated content will comply with the legal standards. Now, let us show you a few ethical boundaries that you should consider while translating videos:</p><h3 id="1-Accuracy"><a href="#1-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="1. Accuracy"></a>1. Accuracy</h3><p> A translated video is useless when it’s inaccurate, and the actual meaning is not delivered. The primary responsibility of a translating video is to ensure the accuracy of the content. Any mistake can lead to misunderstandings and misrepresentations of the message. Thus, it is crucial to convey the message with accurate context details of the material.</p><h3 id="2-Confidentiality"><a href="#2-Confidentiality" class="headerlink" title="2. Confidentiality"></a>2. Confidentiality</h3><p> Some videos might contain confidential data like interviews and personal information. In such cases, you should use a reliable live video translator. It must contain all essential data encryption systems to ensure privacy and security. If you are a third-party translating video, then you should not disclose any confidential data.</p><h3 id="3-Cultural-Sensitivity"><a href="#3-Cultural-Sensitivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Cultural Sensitivity"></a>3. Cultural Sensitivity</h3><p> Every culture has its own predefined boundaries and traditions for good. Translators should look for what is acceptable in a culture or what is offensive. By keeping that in view, they should translate in an appropriate language. In this regard, you can avoid slang language or jargon as per cultural norms. It is essential to avoid cultural violations in translation that might cause legal issues.</p><h3 id="4-Quality-and-Objectivity"><a href="#4-Quality-and-Objectivity" class="headerlink" title="4. Quality and Objectivity"></a>4. Quality and Objectivity</h3><p><strong>Translate live video</strong> in a way that maintains the original quality and meaning of the content. Translators should strive to provide high-quality translations. They must avoid poor translation that could lead to confusion and mislead. Furthermore, it’s important to avoid indulging personal biases and opinions in translations. Ethically, translators should be neutral, particularly in political controversies translation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012406/19272" target="_top" id="2012406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Transparency"><a href="#5-Transparency" class="headerlink" title="5.

The first step involves the entering of input data. This data acts as a set of instructions, descriptions, characters, keywords, and other required details.</p><p> Afterward, semantic understanding is conducted through NLP and NER models. Such models extract information from the input text, such as characters, locations, dialogues, etc. This step is significant as it helps produce a relevant visual video for the user.</p><p> Once done, the AI tool starts planning the video scenes through the extracted information. While creating the structure of the video, the tool selects relevant objects, backgrounds, transitions, graphics, and overlays. Afterward, the AI tool adds visual elements and effects to make a creative video. If the video is animated, the tool adds a sense of motion to the objects, backgrounds, and characters.</p><p> Moreover, human emotion is also added according to the script’s demand. If there are dialogues between the characters, the AI tool will use its TTS engine to produce voiceovers. During this process, relevant background music and sound effects are added to ensure the captivity of the video. Once the visual and audio data is generated, the tool merges each scene smartly.</p><p> This rendering process also includes lip-syncing, transitions, and overall timing. Some AI tools also introduce quality control techniques to eliminate errors from the video. You can also give respective feedback to refine the results. The final stage produces a complete video in the required file format. Afterward, you can add further customization and share the video on multiple platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Best-Free-AI-Text-to-Video-Generator-Tools"><a href="#Part-2-10-Best-Free-AI-Text-to-Video-Generator-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Best Free AI Text-to-Video Generator Tools"></a>Part 2: 10 Best Free AI Text-to-Video Generator Tools</h2><p> Many<strong>text-to-video AI generators</strong> are capable of producing impressive results.

In the recent wave of development,<strong>deepfake streamers</strong> have emerged as a way of replicating people in videos. Creators are also using<strong>deepfake live streams</strong> to engage viewers with avatars that look just like their favorite celebs. However, deepfake streams often encounter attacks and issues that may question their authenticity. In this article, we look at some of the hacks creators can use to beat deepfake attacks.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Deepfake-Scandals"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Deepfake-Scandals" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Deepfake Scandals?"></a>Part 1: What is Deepfake Scandals?</h2><p> Deepfake scandals involve incidents when media is manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI) in unethical or harmful ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/5-must-know-hacks-to-beat-deepfake-attacks-streamer-survival-guide-1.jpg"                      alt="deepface scandals"                ></p><p>Some of the issues included in the Deepfake scandals include:</p><ol><li><strong>Misinformation and Disinformation:</strong> Creation of misleading and false videos or audio recordings of public figures, which helps to sway public opinion and influence elections.</li><li><strong>Financial Fraud:</strong> Impersonating someone to gain access to their financial accounts and other personal information.</li><li><strong>Nonconsensual Deepfake Pornography:</strong> Superimposing an individual’s face or body onto another’s in sexually explicit content without their consent.</li><li><strong>Cyberbullying and harassment:</strong> Creating humiliating or embarrassing videos of an individual to harass or cyberbully them.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Must-read-Tips-for-Deepfake-Streamers"><a href="#Part-2-Must-read-Tips-for-Deepfake-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-read Tips for Deepfake Streamers"></a>Part 2: Must-read Tips for Deepfake Streamers</h2><p> The rise of deepfake content has caught the eyes of many regulatory agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The major concern is the use of deepfakes for crimes like blackmail, extortion, and harassment. With several scandals also pegged to deepfake, streamers need to be conscious of how they use this technology. Here are 5 must-read pieces of advice concerning deepfakes.</p><h3 id="1-Choose-Your-Content-Wisely"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Content-Wisely" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose Your Content Wisely"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Choose Your Content Wisely</strong></h3><p> Although the power of deepfakes is undeniable, creatives can overcome it by choosing content wisely. To be on the safe side, avoid content that treads on sensitive ground. Stay away from topics that spread misinformation, and avoid engaging in malicious humor or issues that involve impersonating real people without their consent. You may be considering using fictional narratives, original characters, or transformative works that push the boundaries of storytelling. Try to be more creative and imaginative in your work while staying within the ethical frameworks.</p><h3 id="2-Be-Transparent-in-Your-Work"><a href="#2-Be-Transparent-in-Your-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. Be Transparent in Your Work"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Be Transparent in Your Work</strong></h3><p> Streamers are often carried away by the buzz or the need to stay in the spotlight. However, being honest and transparent will help you stay authentic with your audience. Right from the onset, try to be as upfront with your views as possible about the use of deepfakes. By being open about your creative journey, you will be enhancing rather than spoiling the magic.</p><p> The way you represent deepfakes to your audience means everything. Announce your personas clearly and explain the technology behind the creation. Use the opportunity to build trust with your audience and engage them in intriguing conversations about the nature of identity and digital representations. Doing so can also help spark more interest among the audience as they realize that they are interacting with a meticulously crafted avatar and not a celebrity clone.</p><h3 id="3-Label-and-Contextualize"><a href="#3-Label-and-Contextualize" class="headerlink" title="3. Label and Contextualize"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Label and Contextualize</strong></h3><p> When you are using deepfakes for streaming, treat your viewer like an intelligent companion. Avoid the mistake of seeing them as gullible marks. Make sure your content is clearly labeled as deepfake through titles, overlays, or disclaimers in your stream. Show that you care about your audience and you do not want to leave them guessing. Explain the purpose behind your chosen person and the creative choices that you have made.</p><h3 id="4-Prioritize-Respect-Over-Reach"><a href="#4-Prioritize-Respect-Over-Reach" class="headerlink" title="4. Prioritize Respect Over Reach"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Prioritize Respect Over Reach</strong></h3><p> Deepfakes allow you to instantly explore fame and what people think of your avatar. However, avoid being carried away by the fame and being swayed to the unethical side. Steer clear of impersonation that can lead to reputational damage or harm vulnerable groups. Even if your avatar is just a fictional character, it still deserves ethical treatment. If it engaged in potential offensive behavior, make sure it is within the confines of your established narrative.</p><h3 id="5-Embrace-the-Collaborative-Spirit"><a href="#5-Embrace-the-Collaborative-Spirit" class="headerlink" title="5. Embrace the Collaborative Spirit"></a><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Embrace the Collaborative Spirit</strong></h3><p> Deepfake streamlining has great potential for community building. You can easily collaborate with other creators by engaging in open discussions and encouraging responsible use of the technology. Working together with other creators also helps you to share knowledge and troubleshoot challenges together. You also get to elevate your content while contributing to a healthier and more responsible deepfake ecosystem.</p><h2 id="Bonus-A-Safe-Choice-for-Live-Streaming-Virbo-Live"><a href="#Bonus-A-Safe-Choice-for-Live-Streaming-Virbo-Live" class="headerlink" title="Bonus - A Safe Choice for Live Streaming: Virbo Live"></a>Bonus - A Safe Choice for Live Streaming: Virbo Live</h2><p> Whether you are a content creator or a brand, you can benefit from the power of AI in your content.

Notice to Readers: Difference of Translating or Transcribing in Tamil</h2><p> Translating and transcribing are two distinct processes. Each is crucial in its own right when it comes to<strong>Tamil language translate to English</strong> :</p><h3 id="Meaning"><a href="#Meaning" class="headerlink" title="Meaning"></a>Meaning</h3><p> Translating is converting the meaning of spoken words or written text from one language to another, like English convert to Tamil meaning. It ensures that the essence and intent remain intact. Transcribing focuses on converting spoken words into written text. It captures the dialogue or narration without considering the nuances of translation.</p><h3 id="Context"><a href="#Context" class="headerlink" title="Context"></a>Context</h3><p> Translation takes into account the broader context of the content. It often factors in cultural references and idiomatic expressions. It also takes into account societal norms to convey the message. Transcription deals with capturing the spoken words. It doesn’t delve into the context or cultural nuances.</p><h3 id="Nuances"><a href="#Nuances" class="headerlink" title="Nuances"></a>Nuances</h3><p> Translation requires knowing both languages involved. It allows you to convey the nuances of the original content. Transcription focuses more on capturing the spoken words. It often doesn’t consider the linguistic nuances or cultural context.</p><p> Automatic translation tools like YouTube can do video translation in Tamil. But, they often struggle to capture the nuances of translating and transcribing. AI-powered apps like <a class="link"   href="https://virbo.wondershare.com/" >Wondershare Virbo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offer a solution by combining translation and transcription.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Translate-Videos-in-Tamil-and-Vice-Versa"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Translate-Videos-in-Tamil-and-Vice-Versa" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Other Methods to Translate in Tamil"></a>Part 3. Other Methods to Translate in Tamil</h2><p> There are alternative methods available if you prefer different English to Tamil translate approaches. Yet, it’s important to note that these methods cater to text translation. They may not capture the nuances and context of video content. Let’s explore two common alternatives:</p><h3 id="Google-Translate"><a href="#Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Google Translate"></a>Google Translate</h3><p> Google Translate is a well-known tool for translating text from one language to another, such as<strong>English to Tamil translation</strong> . Here’s how you can use it for basic translation:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong> : Visit the Google Translate website or open the Google Translate app. Select the input and output languages (e.g., English to Tamil).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg"                      alt="video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2</strong> : Type or paste the text you want to translate into the provided box. Google Translate will instantly translate the text into Tamil.</li></ul><p> Remember that Google Translate may not always produce the most accurate translations. It’s especially evident for complex sentences or specialized terminology.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Video-Translation"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Translation" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Translation"></a>YouTube Video Translation</h3><p> YouTube offers a built-in feature for translating video titles and descriptions. It can also generate subtitles in many languages, including languages from English to Tamil. Here’s how you can use it:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong> : Upload your video to YouTube and navigate to the video’s editing page. Click the<strong>Subtitles&#x2F;CC</strong> tab.</li><li><strong>Step 2</strong> : Select the language you want to translate your subtitles into (e.g., Tamil). YouTube will automatically generate machine-translated subtitles.</li><li><strong>Step 3</strong> : Review and edit the translated subtitles to ensure accuracy and coherence.</li></ul><p><strong>YouTube’s video translation in Tamil</strong> feature can be helpful at times. But, it may not capture the nuances or cultural context accurately. Manual editing is often required to refine the translations. This is important to ensure they align with the original video content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528703/16446" target="_top" id="1528703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528703/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Reaching Tamil-speaking audiences through video translation is essential for expanding reach and engagement.

What is an AI text generator?"></a>Part 1. What is an AI text generator?</h2><p>An AI text generator, also known as a language model, is a software or system that uses artificial intelligence techniques, particularly natural language processing (NLP), to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. Through extensive training on large volumes of text data, these models acquire knowledge of patterns, grammar, and semantics, enabling them to generate cohesive and contextually appropriate text.</p><p>Such as OpenAI, AI text generators can produce a wide range of text, including articles, stories, emails, product descriptions, etc. They can be used for various purposes, such as content creation, chatbots, virtual assistants, and even assisting in writing and editing tasks. The generated text aims to mimic human language and can be customized based on prompts or specific requirements.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What’s-the-working-principle-of-AI-text-generators"><a href="#Part-2-What’s-the-working-principle-of-AI-text-generators" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What’s the working principle of AI text generators?"></a>Part 2. What’s the working principle of AI text generators?</h2><p>The AI text generator operates primarily based on deep learning and natural language processing techniques. It uses neural network models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or variants such as extended short-term memory networks (LSTMs) or transformer models.</p><p>During the training phase, the AI text generator receives vast text data as input. This data can include books, articles, web pages, conversational records, and more. The model learns natural language patterns by analyzing the statistical characteristics, grammar rules, and semantic associations present in the text data.</p><p>The generation of text occurs character by character or word by word. During the generation process, the model predicts the next character or phrase based on the input context and preceding text, ensuring coherence and relevance in the generated output.

According to Microsoft:</p><blockquote><p><em>Though the driver has a minor vulnerability that’s preventing it from loading, it’s most likely not malicious in any way.</em></p></blockquote><p> In other words, the mentioned driver won’t do much harm to your computer even if you don’t do anything with the error message. Based on our experience, the mentioned driver in the**<em>A driver cannot load on this device</em>** message is most likely just too old for your new operating system.</p><p> But if you’re bothered by this error very much, you can still try the methods in this post to get it sorted.</p><h2 id="Try-these-fixes-for-the-A-driver-cannot-load-on-this-device-error"><a href="#Try-these-fixes-for-the-A-driver-cannot-load-on-this-device-error" class="headerlink" title="Try these fixes for the A driver cannot load on this device error"></a>Try these fixes for the A driver cannot load on this device error</h2><p> The following fixes are listed by their simplicity: so you can gently ease your way in the troubleshooting process.

It is also claimed to be the “first Intel Ultra 9 AI Mini PC with a 4-inch Touchscreen.” With the rising popularity of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/hands-on-lian-lis-lcd-screen-fans-turn-heads-and-are-surprisingly-affordable-but-not-as-configurable-as-id-like" >extra screens in PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , integrating one into a compact desktop might be a popular idea.</p><p> Starting from the outside, we see that the AtomMan X7 Ti would be a conventional-looking<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asus-gets-license-to-make-intel-nucs" >NUC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -alike apart from two things. Firstly, it features a 4-inch 480p touch display which covers a fair portion of the top panel. Secondly, it comes with a neat stand that angles the display panel into an easy glanceable view. Furthermore, Minisforum has followed some logic by situating a 1080p<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-fido2-certification-may-update-microsoft,39261.html" >Windows Hello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> compatible webcam and dual mics above the touchscreen, appealing to video conferencing fans.</p><p> While we are considering external features, let’s look at the ports. Despite its compact size (145 x 145 x 49mm), the AtomMan X7 Ti features a decent quantity and selection of ports, as follows: RJ45 5G Ethernet Port ×2, DP 2.0, HDMI 2.1,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/worlds-first-oculink-usb-4-egpu-with-radeor-rx-7600m-xt" >OCulink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Port (up to 64Gbps), USB4 ×2, USB3.2 Gen2 Type-A ×2, USB3.2 Gen1 Type-A, USB2.0, a 3.5mm Combo Jack, SD Card slot, and a Power Button with an embedded fingerprint reader. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-7-faq" >Wi-Fi 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Bluetooth 5.4 complement the dual Ethernet ports. It must also be noted that the mix of dedicated monitor and USB4 ports means you can connect up to four external displays to this machine.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> Moving inside, the star of the show is the new Intel Core Ultra 9 processor<a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236849/intel-core-ultra-9-processor-185h-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html" >185H <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a 16C&#x2F;22T CPU running at up to 5.1 GHz, and onboard Arc GPU with eight Xe cores running at up to 2.35 GHz.

It uses standard DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs, up to a max of 64GB. There are also two M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSD slots, and the aforementioned wireless functionality comes courtesy of a socketed Intel BE200 card, so it can be changed for repair or upgrade.</p><p> We don’t have pricing for the AtomMan X7 Ti. Minisforum says it will go on pre-sale from May 20, so we expect to hear more about pricing and shipping RAM&#x2F;storage configurations at that time. Those particularly interested in this product can sign up for an email about it and get a $30 coupon from Minisforum.</p><p> We caught a first glimpse of the AtomMan X7 Ti<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/minisforum-first-intel-core-ultra-mini-pc-amd-rx-7600M-xt-mini-pc" >at CES 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it was showcased with other interesting new computers like the Minisforum HX200G, Mini Workstation MS-01, and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tablets/minisforum-v3-tablet-arrives-the-worlds-first-amd-ryzen-7-8840u-powered-surface-clone" >V3 tablet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-achieve-video-excellence-without-the-cost-of-fcp/"><u>[New] In 2024, Achieve Video Excellence Without the Cost of FCP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfecting-your-igtv-thumbnail-imagery/"><u>[New] In 2024, Perfecting Your IGTV Thumbnail Imagery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-ace-crews-the-quintessential-list-of-photo-vids-plus-music-maestros/"><u>[Updated] Ace Crews The Quintessential List of Photo Vids + Music Maestros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-listening-out-loud-deciphering-the-differences-between-podcasts-and-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Listening Out Loud Deciphering the Differences Between Podcasts & YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-deep-dive-into-apples-m1-processor-power/"><u>2024 Approved A Deep Dive Into Apple's M1 Processor Power</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-pathway-to-perfect-pitches-insights-from-magix-maker/"><u>2024 Approved The Pathway to Perfect Pitches Insights From Magix Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-simulate-gps-movement-in-ar-games-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Simulate GPS Movement in AR games On Samsung Galaxy S24?
