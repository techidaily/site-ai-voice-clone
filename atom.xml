This tiny device (via<a class="link"   href="https://liliputing.com/onexplayer-m1-is-a-mini-pc-with-intel-core-ultra-9-185h-oculink-and-usb4/" >Liliputing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) has the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to 32 GB of RAM. It also has an RJ45 port, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2, meaning you have three different connectivity options.</p><p> This tiny device has a 200 mm x 120 mm footprint, making it highly portable—it’s so small that you can fit it inside a relatively loose pocket. It also weighs 600 grams, so you don’t have to worry about hurting your back if you want to move your mini-PC.</p><p> However, this small size means that the mini-PC has only limited slots. It can only accommodate a single M.2 2280 SSD and one SODIMM slot so you can say goodbye to the advantages of dual-channel memory.</p><p> Nevertheless, the OneXPlayer M1 does not lack physical ports to connect your devices. It has two USB4 Type-C ports, one USB 3.2 and one USB 2.0 Type-A port, two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, an RJ45 ethernet jack, a 3.5 mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio" >audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> outlet, and a microSD card reader. More importantly, it also comes with an OCuLink port to give you the option to provide it with the graphical oomph of the OneXGPU eGPU.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Image 1 of 5</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p> Aside from the Power button, One-Netbook also gave its mini-PC an RGB button to adjust the RGB lights on the case. But what’s interesting is that the Turbo button from PCs in the 1980s and 1990s is returning on the OneXPlayer M1. The Turbo button will push the 185H’s power draw from the base 45 to 60 watts — just five watts short of its maximum configurable TDP. A 100-watt USB-C power supply also powers the mini-PC, so you’ll have ample power, even pushing the processor to its limit.</p><p> The OneXPlayer M1 has almost the same shape and size as the OneXGPU, with the external GPU weighing about 250 grams heavier. The latter also features several ports, including two HDMI ports, two DisplayPort outlets, two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, a USB4 Type-C port with 100 watts reverse power delivery, and a gigabit RJ45 port. This makes both devices perfect for each other, allowing you to get a fully featured computer you could put in two pockets.</p><p> Pre-orders for a 32 GB RAM &#x2F; 1 TB SSD OneXPlayer M1 are already in Japan at JPY142,310 (or around $900). But if you bundle it with the OneXGPU, you get a 10% discount on the eGPU. So, if you’re looking for a small PC you can quickly move around but don’t sacrifice performance and graphical power, you should watch out for the OneXPlayer M1 mini-PC.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp;

The game begins with the character you’ll play as waking up in a panic. Someone will narrate everything that’s going on to you, including what the area around you looks like. After a short introduction, you’ll be prompted to pick what you want to play as: Glaive, Jack, or Nano. These will roughly translate into someone more physical, someone mixed physical and magical, and a mage, but of course, set in this strange half-fantastical, half-science-fiction world where everything is new and unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/b1_d8ikgtdkSH_Y0F510q_BXpK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-03-d99b43959fa74b31a15f336852f14d75.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> This whole introduction is slow moving and boring, and getting through it is rough. But even past this, things don’t necessarily pick up and get more interesting. The game has such a heavy hand with its narration, telling you the game’s visuals even though you can see them right there on your screen. The whole game reads like someone wrote a novel, couldn’t publish it, and then decided making a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was a better idea, and instead of trimming the fat, they left every unnecessary description and detail in the game’s prompt.</p><p> I did continue forward, even though I was already disinterested, hoping the game would become more gripping. After the memory room, you’ll wake to another platform where a being tells you you’ve suffered a great injury and they are in your mind. He tries to explain who you are but before he gets too far, you’ll be attacked by something called the Sorrow. Eventually, you’ll wake in the real world, enter the game’s main city, and be able to talk to the wealth of characters living there. You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><p> You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148773/18498" target="_top" id="2148773">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148773" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148773/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort"><a href="#Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort"></a><strong>Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort</strong></h2><p> The Tides of Numenera is a third-person<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-offline-rpg-games-4177675" >role-playing game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> where almost 75 percent of the gameplay is scrolling dialogue boxes and the various prompts that will pop up as the game tells you the story. These prompts will allow you control over how the story unfolds, and this, more than anything else, is the game’s main mechanic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8H4QhkgilcsrFlNL40KO1tDnKvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-02-cca6ebdc67d6477ab973b796fb7e773c.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> Beyond this, the other major gameplay mechanic is a system of effort and inspiration. Every action you take will prompt you to use effort. This effort allows for your character to work harder at the chosen action, and thus gives your character a better chance of accomplishing their goal.</p><p> This system is set in place in an attempt to allow you some control over which tasks you want to prioritize with effort―but understand that a lot of the game is built around failure. The game even tells you as much in the introduction. Failing doesn’t mean you’ve messed up, it just means you’ll be set on a different course of the game’s story. Really, I never felt this mechanic offered more than giving players a false sense of control. In reality, the effort prompts didn’t feel like they added much to the overall gameplay experience, they certainly didn’t add any much needed excitement.</p><p> Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> The inspiration aspect is probably the game’s most interesting gameplay mechanic. While you are exploring the world and speaking to characters, you’ll sway them depending on the various prompts. This alignment system will affect the story and what prompts become available for your character. Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> Overall, this game was a weak attempt at offering players the experience of a novel in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> format. The storytelling is very heavy-handed. The writing is weak and full of repeated telling of things you can easily see on-screen around you. There’s little to no direction about where to go or what exactly you should be doing, and combined with the long paragraphs of text, things becomes boring fast. The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way. It’s just a shame that it gets buried under such heavy, inactive storytelling.</p><p> The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic"><a href="#Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Outdated and simplistic"></a><strong>Graphics: Outdated and simplistic</strong></h2><p> Tides of Numenera was created in 2017―however, you wouldn’t know this if you jumped into the game and made a guess based upon the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optimizing-video-game-frame-rates-811784" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The graphics look more like they’re stuck in the early 2000s, with blocky, almost pixelated characters. There is some forgiveness to be had because the game isn’t focused on the visuals―it’s more about the words and the story. But there is a limit to how forgiving one can be considering the game isn’t that old.</p><p> The one positive is the originality in the world the developers have created. The setting feels unique―a mix of strange alien tech within a fantasy city. A wide range of characters will fill the game, and they respond and react in creative ways. It’s also a fun experience to run around and talk to these various characters and explore the game’s world and the lore of Numenera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DfXjCwwtXMVBL58JZmix5sR3vBQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-04-7f9c8617b9cd41738ad2ac02abf0aec9.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139121/17108" target="_top" id="2139121">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139121" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139121/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story"><a href="#Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story" class="headerlink" title="Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story"></a><strong>Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story</strong></h2><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is still an expensive game, costing $50 on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-steam-games-4176308" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it’s not on sale. It’s a game created with a very specific type of player in mind―and I suspect most people are not going to like it.</p><p> That said, if role-playing games with a text-heavy focus are of interest to you, then the game does have a lot to offer for the cost. The world of Numenera is vast, and considering all the prompts that alter the story, the game also has a lot of replayability. While Tides of Numenera wasn’t really my thing, it could be a fun adventure for someone else, and for those players, the $50 cost will be worth it.</p><p> While Tides of Numenera wasn’t really my thing, it could be a fun adventure for someone else.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-story-focused-RPGs"><a href="#Competition-Other-story-focused-RPGs" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other story focused RPGs"></a><strong>Competition: Other story focused RPGs</strong></h2><p> There are quite a few other games available that are story-focused RPGs besides Tides of Numenera. Wasteland 2 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Wasteland-2-Directors-Cut-PlayStation-4/dp/B013CQHQFU/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a very similar game, as it is made by the same developers, but where Numenera falls flat with its heavy-handed storytelling, Wasteland 2 stands apart with a fun, tactical combat system.</p><p> Another third-person RPG that will have a great and well-developed world to explore is Pillars of Eternity (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Pillars-Eternity-Complete-PlayStation-4/dp/B0734T77S2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). The game will allow you to explore a rich fantasy world and its huge dungeon, and while still rich in story, won’t bog you down to the point of boredom. The last game I’ll recommend looking at is any of the Mass Effect titles. Mass Effect does a great job of building a rich science-fiction world while also giving the player a story filled story-altering choices and decisions.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A text-heavy RPG that doesn’t live up to its predecessor.</strong></p><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is a role-playing game focused on creating an experience that is more novel than video game. The storytelling is text heavy, but the world is rich and unique, mixing sci-fi and fantasy elements. Unfortunately, the unique world wasn’t enough to carry me through the outdated graphics and boring gameplay.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Torment: Tides of Numenera</li><li>Product Brand  inXile Entertainment</li><li>Price  $49.99</li><li>ESRB Rating  M for Mature</li><li>Available Platforms  PC, MaxOS,Xbox One, PlayStation 4</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-expertly-convert-videos-on-your-device-with-the-most-trusted-apps-8/"><u>[New] Expertly Convert Videos on Your Device with the Most Trusted Apps #8</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-leading-caller-id-changers-with-enchanting-options/"><u>[Updated] Leading Caller ID Changers with Enchanting Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-revel-in-reality-an-extensive-review-of-lgs-high-fidelity-monitor-31mu97-b/"><u>[Updated] Revel in Reality - An Extensive Review of LG's High-Fidelity Monitor, 31MU97-B</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/2024-approved-is-coqui-voice-cloning-worth-the-hype-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>2024 Approved Is Coqui Voice Cloning Worth the Hype?

According to Wikipedia, there are approximately 422 million Arabic speakers (native &amp; non-native). If you are a content creator, translating English videos to Arabic presents an opportunity to reach such a wide audience. In this article, we will present one such tool that can help you <strong>translate video to Arabic</strong> with ease. We will also discuss common challenges in translating videos to Arabic and how our recommendation overcomes them. So, without further ado, let’s dive in.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Challenges-In-Translating-English-Videos-Into-Arabic"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Challenges-In-Translating-English-Videos-Into-Arabic" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Common Challenges In Translating English Videos Into Arabic"></a>Part 1. Common Challenges In Translating English Videos Into Arabic</h2><p> Below are some common challenges you face when you want to translate videos to Arabic.</p><h4 id="Lack-of-Semantic-Nuances"><a href="#Lack-of-Semantic-Nuances" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Semantic Nuances"></a>Lack of Semantic Nuances</h4><p> Arabic is a very rich language with semantic nuances. As it exhibits a distinct linguistic structure, taking care of linguistic and cultural nuances is the main challenge in accurately capturing the meaning during translation.</p><h4 id="Translating-Idiomatic-Expressions"><a href="#Translating-Idiomatic-Expressions" class="headerlink" title="Translating Idiomatic Expressions"></a>Translating Idiomatic Expressions</h4><p> Translating Arabic idioms, colloquialisms, and culturally specific expressions is difficult as these may not have direct or indirect equivalents in (say, for example) English. AI tools, in particular fail to accurately translate such sentences.</p><h4 id="Considering-Sentence-Structure-Variations"><a href="#Considering-Sentence-Structure-Variations" class="headerlink" title="Considering Sentence Structure Variations"></a>Considering Sentence Structure Variations</h4><p> Maintaining coherence and natural flow is essential for effective communication.

They act as a helping aid in multiple situations, environments, and more. This section of the reading elaborates on the advantages of subtitles below:</p><ol><li><strong>Inclusivity and Accessibility:</strong> Primarily, subtitles make content available to a broader audience. Whether anyone is facing a hearing loss or hearing impairment, they can still read. In scenes where non-native audiences cannot understand speech, they are a savior. In video lectures or tutorials, subtitles enhance the audience’s comprehension.</li><li><strong>Multilingual Translation:</strong> An increased understanding of disabled audiences’ aids in multilingual support. When you generate subtitles for a video, you can transform it into other languages. Later, you can use text-to-speech converters to generate multilingual speech.</li><li><strong>Improved SEO Performance:</strong> You must have been aware of SEO and its ranking policies. Subtitles double your video’s SEO ranking and overall performance. Hence, adding subtitles can help the audience find your video on top search results. This is a valuable marketing tactic for content creators and brands working online.</li><li><strong>Noise-Sensitive Environments:</strong> As lives become demanding, the time of leisure limits every day. Students and professionals entertain themselves during their travel time. However, these environments, like traffic, libraries, and offices, are noise-sensitive. This is where subtitles help with content comprehension when you cannot hear.</li><li><strong>Improved Learning:</strong> People try to learn multiple languages via video content. Subtitles help them with better comprehension by engaging both audio and visual senses. The audience also has a visual representation of spoken language for quick learning. They also clarify any misunderstandings of dialogues and maintain consistency.</li><li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> In some regions, adding subtitles is a legal requirement. For instance, communist nations make them compulsory for their disabled audience. Thus, instead of hiring editors or translators, video speech-to-text converters online are preferable.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-Well-Has-AI-Adapted-to-Converting-Video-Content-into-Text"><a href="#Part-3-How-Well-Has-AI-Adapted-to-Converting-Video-Content-into-Text" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Well Has AI Adapted to Converting Video Content into Text?"></a>Part 3: How Well Has AI Adapted to Converting Video Content into Text?</h2><p> In the past, the procedure to<strong>translate video audio to text</strong>  was quite complex.

Guidelines for Creating Accurate Spanish Translation</h2><h5 id="01-of-10-Understand-the-Context"><a href="#01-of-10-Understand-the-Context" class="headerlink" title="01 of 10 Understand the Context"></a><strong>01</strong> of 10 Understand the Context</h5><p> Most AI translation tools lack contextual understanding. Make sure the translated text provides complete sentences or phrases without skipping any important detail.</p><h5 id="02-of-10-Check-the-Formality"><a href="#02-of-10-Check-the-Formality" class="headerlink" title="02 of 10 Check the Formality"></a><strong>02</strong> of 10 Check the Formality</h5><p> Spanish has formal and informal forms of address. Make sure the Spanish to English video translation tool reflects the appropriate level of formality based on the context and relationship between the conversing parties.</p><h5 id="03-of-10-Be-Mindful-of-Idioms"><a href="#03-of-10-Be-Mindful-of-Idioms" class="headerlink" title="03 of 10 Be Mindful of Idioms"></a><strong>03</strong> of 10 Be Mindful of Idioms</h5><p> Idiomatic expressions in Spanish don’t always have direct equivalents in English. AI tools may struggle with these, so be ready to simplify or rephrase to convey the intended message accurately.</p><h5 id="04-of-10-Review-Regional-Variations"><a href="#04-of-10-Review-Regional-Variations" class="headerlink" title="04 of 10 Review Regional Variations"></a><strong>04</strong> of 10 Review Regional Variations</h5><p> Spanish varies across regions. For instance, Spanish in Latin America is vastly different from Spanish in Spain. Therefore, you should consider the target audience’s region and adjust translations accordingly, especially for colloquialisms and regional vocabulary.</p><h5 id="05-of-10-Verify-Technical-Terms"><a href="#05-of-10-Verify-Technical-Terms" class="headerlink" title="05 of 10 Verify Technical Terms"></a><strong>05</strong> of 10 Verify Technical Terms</h5><p> For specialized or technical content, verify that the Spanish video translator understands and translates industry-specific terms correctly. You can provide additional context in the preview if needed.</p><h5 id="06-of-10-Double-Check-Tenses"><a href="#06-of-10-Double-Check-Tenses" class="headerlink" title="06 of 10 Double-Check Tenses"></a><strong>06</strong> of 10 Double-Check Tenses</h5><p> Spanish and English express time differently. Ensure the AI captures the correct tense, especially in complex sentences, to convey the intended temporal meaning accurately.</p><h5 id="07-of-10-Handle-Gender-Sensitively"><a href="#07-of-10-Handle-Gender-Sensitively" class="headerlink" title="07 of 10 Handle Gender Sensitively"></a><strong>07</strong> of 10 Handle Gender Sensitively</h5><p> Spanish had a binary (masculine&#x2F;feminine) gender system only, while US English has multiple. Ensure the AI translates gender-sensitive terms appropriately and consistently throughout the text.</p><h5 id="08-of-10-Consider-Sentence-Structure"><a href="#08-of-10-Consider-Sentence-Structure" class="headerlink" title="08 of 10 Consider Sentence Structure"></a><strong>08</strong> of 10 Consider Sentence Structure</h5><p> Spanish and English have different sentence structures. Verify that the translated text maintains clarity and coherence while respecting the syntactic rules of the target language.</p><h5 id="09-of-10-Proofread-and-Edit"><a href="#09-of-10-Proofread-and-Edit" class="headerlink" title="09 of 10 Proofread and Edit"></a><strong>09</strong> of 10 Proofread and Edit</h5><p> AI tools may not catch nuanced errors. So, if you want to translate voice&#x2F;videos from Spanish into any language, proofread the translated text. Check for grammatical accuracy, style, and overall fluency. Make necessary edits to enhance readability.</p><h5 id="10-of-10-Add-Human-Touch"><a href="#10-of-10-Add-Human-Touch" class="headerlink" title="10 of 10 Add Human Touch"></a><strong>10</strong> of 10 Add Human Touch</h5><p> While AI tools are a great help for translation, they lack the nuanced understanding that humans possess.

Following are our top choices for 8 explainer video categories:</p><h3 id="1-Whiteboard-Animation"><a href="#1-Whiteboard-Animation" class="headerlink" title="1. Whiteboard Animation"></a>1. <strong>Whiteboard Animation</strong></h3><p> Whiteboard videos became increasingly popular in the early 2010s as a result of their then-lower production costs. A whiteboard will be used to annotate text and photos. The video is then sped up and has voiceover added to it. They are easy to make and have been shown to work with a variety of audiences if you have a great artist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg"                      alt="animated-explainer-videos-whiteboard-videos.jpg"                ></p><p> Whiteboard explanation videos are really entertaining to watch despite being so straightforward. It consists of a live hand painting with vibrant markers on a whiteboard. The fluid way the hand glides while producing the ideal drawings, together with the voice-over that guides the spectator, draws them in and increases interest.</p><h3 id="2-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#2-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="2. Motion Graphics"></a>2. <strong>Motion Graphics</strong></h3><p> This kind of explainer video is more common in the technology sector since it clearly and simply presents complicated ideas. Motion graphics, which go beyond typical animation, are excellent in illustrating more complex concepts that might be hard to visualize. They provide a fun approach to contextualize subjects that would otherwise be difficult to explain via the use of shapes, colors, and other components.  </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg"                      alt="animated-explainer-videos-motion-graphics-videos.jpg"                ></p><p> One of the reasons 2D Motion Graphics are so successful is the ease with which a brand emblem, which is naturally a picture, can be transformed or combined with other images. App demonstrations, technical animations, financial visuals, and business explainer videos are the best uses for it. This design is effective because it draws customers’ attention to the desired area while without being too crowded.</p><h3 id="3-2D-animation"><a href="#3-2D-animation" class="headerlink" title="3. 2D animation"></a>3. <strong>2D animation</strong></h3><p> One of the most well-liked and widely used methods. These videos are the ideal kind of low-cost, simple-to-create content that people can share. We believe that motion graphics are intended to be used for marketing, communication, and entertainment. This approach promotes brand awareness and trust while making a complex product or service easier to understand.  </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg"                      alt="animated-explainer-videos-2d-videos.jpg"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100537/7443" target="_top" id="2100537">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100537" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100537/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> An established format for explanation videos is 2D. In other words, images are utilized to demonstrate the operation of the product or service and the advantages that the user will experience. Videos using 2D motion graphics animation also seem vibrant, new, and lively. For businesses with a little budget who want to seem professional but can’t afford the cost associated with 3D methods, this is a perfect option.</p><h3 id="4-3D-animation"><a href="#4-3D-animation" class="headerlink" title="4. 3D animation"></a>4. <strong>3D animation</strong></h3><p> If you have the money to spend on a 3D explainer video, you’ll stand out from the more conventional 2D approach. In terms of computer animation productions, 3D explainer videos are pricey. Due to the additional work required to make any alterations or tweaks compared to the other types, timelines tend to be lengthier.  </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg"                      alt="animated-explainer-videos-3d-videos.jpg"                ></p><p> Consider 3D animation if you’re a detail-oriented person. One of the most opulent and costly explainer videos available, but for good cause. Each frame is laboriously and painstakingly created, taking far longer than in a typical video. To produce a picture with height, breadth, and depth, they use detail. But due to the mind-blowing ingenuity put into it, the results are incredible, capturing the highest engagement and conversion rate!</p><h3 id="5-Live-action"><a href="#5-Live-action" class="headerlink" title="5. Live-action"></a>5. <strong>Live-action</strong></h3><p> Live-action explainer videos, as the name implies, have actors or presenters explaining a topic. These videos have very little animation and motion graphics and are produced using genuine footage. The primary objective is still to describe a good or service, and this might include user reviews.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/marketing/explainer-video/animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg"                      alt="animated-explainer-videos-live-action-videos.jpg"                ></p><p> Because of this, you have to think about the greatest and most practical instrument for making these animation videos.

A few things you can look for to check your Internet connection go as below:</p><ul><li>Try to <strong>power cycle your router and modem</strong> . Unplug the power cables from your router and your modem, leave them disconnected for at least 30 seconds, then plug the cables back into both devices. When your Internet is working again, check if you still get the error code leaf.</li><li>If you’re playing Apex Legends on Wi-Fi, make sure there’s no overcrowding. In other words, <strong>if your Wi-Fi is connected to multiple devices, disconnect the ones you don’t need at the moment.</strong><br> (Also if possible,<strong>play on</strong> <strong>a wired connection</strong> . It’d provide a more stable and reliable connection.)</li><li>If you have low-speed Internet, it could lead to an unstable Internet connection.

You may want to update your network adapter driver to make sure it’s functioning properly.</p><p> There are two ways you can get the right driver for your network adapter:<strong>manually</strong> or<strong>automatically</strong> .</p><p><strong>Manual driver update</strong> – You can update the network adapter driver<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >via Device Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Note that Windows doesn’t update its database very frequently. That said, it’s possible that your network adapter driver needs an update, but Device Manager can’t do it for you if it doesn’t detect a new version in the Windows database.</p><p><strong>Automatic driver update</strong> – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network adapter and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:</p><ol><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install Driver Easy.</p></li><li><p>Run Driver Easy and click the <strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

One last thing that players can do is to switch to a low ping server. The option of choosing a server is hidden, and here’s how to bring it to the front:</p><ol><li>Launch Apex Legends.</li><li>When you see the main page with the Continue button in the middle, wait for at least 1 minute. DO NOT press any keys or click any button on the screen.</li><li>When you’re prompted to exit the game, click<strong>Cancel</strong> to go back to the main page.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/exit-game.png"                                     ></li><li>Now you’ll see an option of<strong>Data Center</strong> at the bottom of your main page.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/data-centers.png"                                     ><br>5. Click<strong>Data Center</strong> , then you’ll see a list of all available servers with their ping times and loss rate. You can choose a low ping server or try several servers until you can join the game.</p><hr><p> Hopefully this article solves the error code leaf for you and you can now join a match on Apex Legends!

What is an AI artist?</strong></h2><p>AI artist refers to an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to create art autonomously or assist human artists in their creative process. AI artists use machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to analyze and understand patterns in existing artworks and generate new art based on that knowledge.</p><p>Some AI artists can create paintings, drawings, or digital art, while others can generate music, poetry, or video content. They work by learning from a vast dataset of existing artworks or creative content and then producing original pieces that mimic the style, themes, or elements present in those examples.</p><p>AI artists are not meant to replace human creativity but rather to augment it and inspire new ideas. They can be valuable tools for artists to experiment with different styles, generate concepts, or overcome creative blocks.

What is an AI artist?"></a><strong>Part 1. What is an AI artist?</strong></h2><p>AI artist refers to an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to create art autonomously or assist human artists in their creative process. AI artists use machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to analyze and understand patterns in existing artworks and generate new art based on that knowledge.</p><p>Some AI artists can create paintings, drawings, or digital art, while others can generate music, poetry, or video content. They work by learning from a vast dataset of existing artworks or creative content and then producing original pieces that mimic the style, themes, or elements present in those examples.</p><p>AI artists are not meant to replace human creativity but rather to augment it and inspire new ideas. They can be valuable tools for artists to experiment with different styles, generate concepts, or overcome creative blocks. AI art is continually evolving, and the creations of AI artists often spark discussions about the intersection of technology and creativity in the art world.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-AI-artists-1"><a href="#Part-2-Guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-AI-artists-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Using this feature helped companies humanize their brand by telling stories.</p><p> According to a <a class="link"   href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/instagram-live-shopping-reach-customers" >report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , many Instagram users shopped weekly on the platform. They utilized many features like shopping tags and the “Shop” tab. However, Instagram stopped supporting live shopping on March 16, 2023. It was decided so that Instagram could focus more on other features of their application.</p><h3 id="Reason-for-Discontinuing-Live-Shopping-Feature"><a href="#Reason-for-Discontinuing-Live-Shopping-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Reason for Discontinuing Live Shopping Feature"></a>Reason for Discontinuing Live Shopping Feature</h3><p><strong>Live shopping on Instagram</strong> depends on the product quality. About 55% of the customers reported having this issue with live shopping. There are various other drawbacks to Instagram’s live selling feature, which are provided as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>More Focus on Other Features:</strong> Instagram wanted to focus on other app features. For this reason, they discontinued live shopping, which required utmost attention.</li><li><strong>Declining Engagement:</strong> After the pandemic, online users became less engaged with livestream shopping. So, Instagram shifted its focus to the Reels feature.</li><li><strong>Customer Feedback:</strong> The comments and suggestions on the live streams demanded improvements. Also, the<strong>live-selling Instagram</strong> feature did not bear positive comments from the customers.</li><li><strong>Lack of Communication:</strong> Sometimes, the online team cannot properly communicate with customers. The lack of communication causes confusion and dissatisfaction among customers.</li><li><strong>Limited Availability:</strong> The live shopping Instagram feature had geographical limitations. Various brands couldn’t provide their customers with their products in different places. Moreover, such conditions limit customer access and bring negative comments.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Wondershare-Virbo-Live-Enhance-Your-Livestreaming-Selling-Experience"><a href="#Part-2-Wondershare-Virbo-Live-Enhance-Your-Livestreaming-Selling-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This heavy brick of a portable charger proves to be a handy tool, especially in the car—whether for emergencies or when you need to top up a device while you’re away from home.</p><p> Granted, it doesn’t pack as much power as some dedicated laptop chargers, which may be a better option for that need. Still, the added versatility gives the Halo Bolt a unique edge in the market. I tested the Halo Bolt for a week with multiple devices, including laptops and smartphones.</p><h2 id="Design-The-shiny-brick"><a href="#Design-The-shiny-brick" class="headerlink" title="Design: The shiny brick"></a><strong>Design: The shiny brick</strong></h2><p> While certainly portable, the Halo Bolt isn’t designed to be pocket-friendly. This big brick of a battery pack comes in at 7.2 x 1.6 x 3.8 inches (HWD) with a weight of more than 1.5 pounds. Smaller, cheaper battery packs are available for smartphones, but this beast is made for heavier-duty needs and is designed accordingly.</p><p> It’s made of mostly thick black plastic outside, including a glossy brushed silver top layer with an imprinted Halo logo. The front face is where most of the ports sit, including two USB-A ports (5V&#x2F;2.4A), a DC input for the charging adapter, and jump-start inputs hidden behind a small door. The right side, meanwhile, has the 115V AC&#x2F;65W max AC power plug input for laptop chargers and other plug-in devices.</p><p> Smaller, cheaper battery packs are available for smartphones, but this beast is made for heavier-duty needs and is designed accordingly.</p><p> Each set of inputs has a power button to activate the ports, and you can use the AC input and USB ports simultaneously, but the Jump Starter can only function independently. Meanwhile, the left side of the device has a bright built-in LED flashlight with a power button, giving you another handy tool during car emergencies.</p><p> The Halo Bolt also comes with an array of accessories, including a wall charging adapter, a car charging adapter, jumper cables, a USB-to-micro USB cable, and a cinching pouch for quick storage of all the above. All of the cables and accessories are a welcome bonus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nYYltjJN71EGK1Dwv2_XABixuhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-04-85b590a9939a4f44b0c7a510a456b80f.jpg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Load-it-up"><a href="#Setup-Process-Load-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Load it up"></a><strong>Setup Process: Load it up</strong></h2><p> You’ll need to charge the brick to total capacity before using it, and the four green battery lights on the right side of the front face indicate how much capacity is currently left. The battery is fully charged when all four are illuminated when pressing any of the power buttons. Otherwise, for the AC and USB ports, the Halo Bolt is a plug-and-play charger.</p><p> The whole process for jump-starting a car is detailed in the included instructions. The Halo Bolt has built-in safety features that ensure you have correctly aligned the jumper cables before starting the connected car, boat, lawnmower, or other vehicles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mUdXUjWxeupVqNR_y43_eFTC0ic=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-02-69b93dc934684ef5b71a40215f6162f2.jpg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105883/7443" target="_top" id="2105883">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105883" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105883/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Not-so-long-lasting"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Not-so-long-lasting" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: Not so long-lasting"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: Not so long-lasting</strong></h2><p> The Halo Bolt has 58,830mWh of battery power within, and the official description suggests that it can provide up to several hours of additional usage for a MacBook Pro or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-4688969" >iPad Air <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In my testing, the results didn’t quite match those targets.</p><p> Plugging in a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2019-review-4770116" >mid-2019 MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge. It went from 0 percent to 88 percent in 1 hour and 30 minutes, at a maximum recorded charging rate of 58.29W (20.1V&#x2F;1.9A).</p><p> In a separate test, I played a locally-downloaded movie on loop at 100 percent brightness on the laptop, with the Halo Bolt plugged in to sustain the laptop’s fully-charged battery. The Halo Bolt provided power to the computer for 5 hours, 14 minutes before running out of battery, but that’s a fair bit less than the Mophie Powerstation AC (6 hours, 22 minutes) and ZMI PowerPort 20000 (8 hours, 4 minutes) in the same test.</p><p> Plugging in a mid-2019 MacBook Pro (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge.</p><p> Not having a USB-C Power Delivery port on the Halo Bolt is disappointing, as many modern devices rely on the standard for speedy charging. You’ll need to bring your own AC adapters to plug into the AC port to get maximum speeds.</p><p> For example, charging a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-4685690" >Samsung Galaxy S10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone using one of the Halo Bolt’s USB-A ports took 2 hours and 56 minutes to complete at a paltry 5.19W (4.76V x 1.09A), starting from 0 percent. However, when I repeated the test using Samsung’s charger via the AC port, it finished in 1 hour and 34 minutes thanks to fast charging—nearly half the total time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MNFqifirQ0sn61GPO1e-bLQ1t8s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-06-8bc3449bd35243aaaf67272c1d3774a6-bc803e0a114b4116adf3078af6a2de00.jpeg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-priced-right"><a href="#Price-It’s-priced-right" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s priced right"></a><strong>Price: It’s priced right</strong></h2><p> For a jack-of-all-trades power brick that can jump-start your car and charge its battery, serve as a bright flashlight for roadside emergencies, and charge a wide array of portable devices, the $100 price seen on Amazon looks pretty reasonable. However, given that it couldn’t charge my laptop to total capacity and lacks a USB-C port, handier, higher-capacity charging bricks are available specifically for laptop and smartphone charging needs.</p><h2 id="Halo-Bolt-ACDC-58830-vs-ZMI-PowerPack-20000"><a href="#Halo-Bolt-ACDC-58830-vs-ZMI-PowerPack-20000" class="headerlink" title="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830 vs. ZMI PowerPack 20000"></a><strong>Halo Bolt ACDC 58830 vs. ZMI PowerPack 20000</strong></h2><p> Here’s a prime example. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/zmi-powerpack-20000-review-5071991" >ZMI PowerPack 20000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BD98CM?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5071993%7Cn35698be70c304b229c7a194255ab2d3620%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have an AC port. However, it’s pocket-friendly, packs a lot of capacity (20,000mAh), and can quickly recharge laptops with its included USB-C port. It also has two USB-A ports and sufficient juice to recharge the same MacBook Pro from empty. Best of all, it only costs $70.</p><p> But that smaller, cheaper power brick is only meant for portable devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and handheld game systems. It has no jump-start capabilities nor an AC port to accommodate a wider array of devices.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Final Verdict: A convenient backup battery and jump starter.</strong></p><p> The Halo Bolt isn’t the best option for charging laptops, but it is a solid all-around device for providing backup power to a broader array of gadgets, not to mention jump-starting a car. This versatile device is smart to have around if you drive a car and are frequently mobile with your portable gadgets. I wouldn’t bring it with me on vacation, but it could prove useful before long as a backup device to keep handy.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Bolt ACDC 58830 mWh Portable Charger&#x2F;Jump Starter</li><li>Product Brand  Halo</li><li>SKU  811279030120</li><li>Price  $100.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.2 x 3.8 x 1.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  90 Days</li><li>Ports  2x USB-A. 1x AC, 1x Jump Start</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-dodge-digital-watchers-accelerating-view-count-growth/"><u>[New] Dodge Digital Watchers Accelerating View Count Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-creating-a-captivating-instagram-cover-for-your-topics-highlight/"><u>[New] In 2024, Creating a Captivating Instagram Cover for Your Topics Highlight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/2024-approved-what-is-an-ai-tool/"><u>2024 Approved What Is an AI Tool?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-call-history-from-realme-11-proplus-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted call history from Realme 11 Pro+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-unlock-your-sony-xperia-1-v-by-drfone-android/"><u>Full Guide to Unlock Your Sony Xperia 1 V</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exploring-ai-face-generators-wondershare-virbo-glossary/"><u>New 2024 Approved Exploring AI Face Generators | Wondershare Virbo Glossary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/restart-and-repair-a-comprehensive-guide-to-resolving-rainbow-six-sieges-voice-chat-problem-in-the-new-patch-of-2024/"><u>Restart and Repair: A Comprehensive Guide to Resolving Rainbow Six Siege's Voice Chat Problem in the New Patch of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/updated-create-ai-avatar-videos-wondershare-virbo-for-2024/"><u>Updated Create AI Avatar Videos | Wondershare Virbo for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/updated-diverse-template-online-for-2024/"><u>Updated Diverse Template | Online for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

PCs like this are commonly described as having adopted the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-raptor-lake-mobile-chips-get-soldered-to-micro-atx-motherboards" >MoDT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Mobile on Desktop) hybrid design.<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-touted-as-worlds-first-amd-advantage-mini-pc-packs-an-amd-r9-7945hx-and-rx-7600m-xt" >Mini PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/all-in-one-pcs" >All-in-Ones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were the first to make MoDT popular, but they also usually used mobile GPUs (or just integrated graphics). In contrast, Lenovo’s new Legion 7000K PC series, now<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1037096.html" >available in China <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , come in sizable tower cases and are sold with powerful Nvidia<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-ada-lovelace-and-geforce-rtx-40-series-everything-we-know" >GeForce RTX 40 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> series GPUs pre-installed.</p><p> With an MoDT platform, if you want to change your CPU you would have to buy a complete new mainboard &#x2F; CPU &#x2F; cooler bundle. Mobile CPUs aren’t socketed but are<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-soldering-irons" >soldered <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the board, so the average tech enthusiast isn’t going to be able to swap or upgrade the CPU. Thus it is very important to consider this spec very carefully before committing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KiWmBjf3WBxdHs7uNFYu2U-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Legion 7000K gaming PCs"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Lenovo)</p><p> Looking more closely at the new Legion 7000K machines, we see that they come with a choice between two pretty strong Intel Raptor Lake Refresh mobile CPUs. The most powerful option is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-unleashes-14th-gen-raptor-lake-refresh-hx-series-laptops-cpus-refreshed-chips-with-up-to-24-cores-58-ghz-boost-clock-and-192gb-ddr5-support" >Core i9-14900HX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with 24C&#x2F;32C, clock speeds up to 5.8 GHz, and 36MB Smart Cache. This powerful chip can be quite thrifty with its 55W base power, but also has a max turbo power of a laptop-melting 157W. In<a class="link"   href="https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks" >Geekbench <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> nT rankings, for example, the performance of this CPU sits snugly between the Core i9-13900 and the Ryzen 9 PRO 7945 desktop chips – so it isn’t a lightweight.</p><p> One other CPU option is available to buyers, and that is the Core i7-14650HX. This is a 16C&#x2F;24T part, with clock speeds up to 5.2 GHz, and 30MB Smart Cache. Again there is a standard TDP of 55W, with the chip attempting to suck up to 157W if the situation demands it and cooling is adequate.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> As with other MoDT platforms, we aren’t sure if the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpu-coolers,4181.html" >cooling system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is easy to change or upgrade, as the mounts won’t likely be the same as in a desktop PC. Lenovo seems to indicate its CPU cooler is good for up to 190W. If the CPU cooling fan is standard, we guess it could be changed or upgraded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KHmtZBvJU6LcChAReYSDBU-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Legion 7000K gaming PCs"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Lenovo)</p><p> Another spec of the Legion 7000K gaming desktop that users will have to decide upon is what GPU to choose. The product page allows the choice of RTX 4060 &#x2F; Ti, RTX 4070 Ti &#x2F; Super. As with a traditional desktop PC, users can upgrade at any time later.</p><p> Lastly, the new Legion systems come with a standard 32GB DDR5-5600 dual-channel RAM and 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html" >PCIe Gen4 storage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Again, upgrades shouldn’t be a problem in the future with SODIMMs presumably used for RAM, and two M.2 slots and two SATA ports available for storage.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> A wide range of I&#x2F;O is available from the motherboard including one USB 3.2 gen2 Type-C, a plethora of other USB Type A ports,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio" >audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I&#x2F;O, 2.5G Ethernet (Wi-Fi 6 is also onboard), and DP video. The desktop GPU also has a trio of DP ports and an HDMI 2.1a output. Front I&#x2F;O consists of twin USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A ports and audio I&#x2F;O. The system also comes with Nahimic 5.1 sound and some<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-rgb-controls-native" >RGB lighting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Lenovo is selling these Legion 7000K systems in China starting from around $1,300 (i7, RTX 4060), all the way up to around $2,350 (i9, RTX 4070 Ti Super). If those direct currency exchange figure prices were actual U.S. prices, these MoDT pre-builts wouldn’t really be very interesting. Customers should expect a decent discount to accept the CPU upgrade (and other) limitations.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamline-your-watching-enabling-youtube-autoplay-in-facebook-feeds/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamline Your Watching Enabling YouTube Autoplay in Facebook Feeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-pinnacle-play-best-of-royale-multiplayer-matches/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Pinnacle Play Best of Royale Multiplayer Matches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-best-conversion-techniques-youtube-to-mpeg-encoding/"><u>[Updated] Best Conversion Techniques YouTube to MPEG Encoding</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-seamlessly-integrating-zoom-with-facebook-live/"><u>2024 Approved Seamlessly Integrating Zoom with Facebook Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-checklist-for-selecting-prime-streaming-services-of-cricket/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Checklist for Selecting Prime Streaming Services of Cricket</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/6-proven-ways-to-unlock-vivo-y78plus-phone-when-you-forget-the-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>6 Proven Ways to Unlock Vivo Y78+ Phone When You Forget the Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/best-12-ai-voice-cloning-tools-online-and-offline-for-2024/"><u>Best 12 AI Voice Cloning Tools Online & Offline for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/create-video-with-ai-avatar/"><u>Create Video with AI Avatar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/detailed-review-of-doctorsim-unlock-service-for-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Detailed Review of doctorSIM Unlock Service For Apple iPhone 6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/futureproofing-your-data-with-budgeted-cloud-choices/"><u>Futureproofing Your Data with Budgeted Cloud Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/in-2024-ai-script-wondershare-virbo-online/"><u>In 2024, AI Script | Wondershare Virbo Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/in-2024-implementing-gradual-audio-reduction-tricks-in-audacity/"><u>In 2024, Implementing Gradual Audio Reduction Tricks in Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-5-ai-movie-script-generators/"><u>New 2024 Approved Best 5 AI Movie Script Generators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/new-finding-the-best-voice-changers-to-sound-like-star-warss-stormtrooper/"><u>New Finding The Best Voice Changers To Sound Like Star Warss Stormtrooper</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-12-ai-voice-cloning-tools-online-and-offline/"><u>New In 2024, Best 12 AI Voice Cloning Tools Online & Offline</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/new-talking-photo-wondershare-virbo-for-2024/"><u>New Talking Photo | Wondershare Virbo for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-5-smart-tips-about-youtube-shorts-to-grow-your-business/"><u>Updated In 2024, 5 Smart Tips About YouTube Shorts to Grow Your Business</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-what-is-ai-background-generator/"><u>Updated In 2024, What Is AI Background Generator?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/visual-branding-on-youtubes-iconography-and-images/"><u>Visual Branding on YouTubes Iconography and Images</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none;

Here’s how:</p><p> If you don’t have a dedicated GPU at all, you can directly jump to <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Fix 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><p><strong>1)</strong> Right-click any empty space on the desktop and click<strong>NVIDIA Control Panel</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-3-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>2)</strong> Click<strong>3D settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Manage 3D settings</strong> in the left pane.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-4.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>3)</strong> Select the<strong>Program Settings</strong> tab and select<strong>War Thunder</strong> from the drop-down list.

To gain a smooth and optimal gaming experience, you should update your graphics driver on a regular basis.</p><p> There are two ways you can do this: <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >manually <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  or <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >automatically <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><h4 id="Option-1-–-Update-the-graphics-driver-manually"><a href="#Option-1-–-Update-the-graphics-driver-manually" class="headerlink" title="Option 1 – Update the graphics driver manually"></a>Option 1 – Update the graphics driver manually</h4><p> Graphics card manufacturers keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to their websites such as <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" >AMD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  and <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" >NVIDIA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  , then find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.</p><p> Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.</p><h4 id="Option-2-–-Automatically-update-the-graphics-driver"><a href="#Option-2-–-Automatically-update-the-graphics-driver" class="headerlink" title="Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics driver"></a>Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics driver</h4><p> If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.</p><p> You can update your drivers automatically with either the<strong>FREE</strong> or the<strong>Pro version</strong> of Driver Easy. But with the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Pro version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  it takes just 2 clicks:</p><p><strong>1)</strong> <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  and install Driver Easy.</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Run Driver Easy and click the<strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

(This requires the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Pro version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.

In this article, we introduce Talk Shop Live as a live shopping platform and provide a brief guide on how to start your livestream on the platform.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TalkShopLive"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TalkShopLive" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is TalkShopLive?"></a>Part 1: What is TalkShopLive?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://talkshop.live/" >TalkShopLive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a social-selling network for home shopping and live streaming shows. It comes with a built-in buying experience for all kinds of shoppers. With Talk Shop Live, anyone can sell and buy products from anywhere through interactive video shows. You can think of ShopTalk Live as a combination of HSN, QVC, and social media tolled into one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/is-talkshoplive-right-for-you-live-shop-pros-tips-before-you-start-1.jpg"                      alt="talk shop live"                ></p><p> The TalkShopLive studio app for brands and creators brings an array of broadcast and management tools to mobile. The platform boasts of enabling users to promote and sell their shows before and after going live.

With this studio app, you can virtually collaborate with four people in a live stream, simulcast on Facebook, pin comments, and more. The platform is embeddable and shoppable anywhere, allowing you to host shows across platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Who-Can-Benefit-from-Talkshoplive"><a href="#Part-2-Who-Can-Benefit-from-Talkshoplive" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Who Can Benefit from Talkshoplive?"></a>Part 2: Who Can Benefit from Talkshoplive?</h2><p> The Walmart Talk Shop Live can potentially benefit a wide range of people.

The producer or moderator can be part of the live stream without being on the screen, manage sales, pin lie comments, highlight items, and perform other duties.</li><li><strong>Customers:</strong> Use the proprietary multi-embedded point-of-sale technology to purchase an item during a live show without interrupting the live shopping experience.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Should-You-Start-Talkshoplive-Live-Shopping-Event"><a href="#Part-3-Should-You-Start-Talkshoplive-Live-Shopping-Event" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Should You Start Talkshoplive Live Shopping Event?"></a>Part 3: Should You Start Talkshoplive Live Shopping Event?</h2><p> TalkShopLive does more than just live streaming.

Then, click the<strong>Voicebox</strong> tab and choose one of the sound effects. Speak to your microphone to listen, preview, and possibly change the new voice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/voicemod-ai-3.jpg"                      alt="choose a voice effect on voicemod ai"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If the voice is working, head to the application or browser tab where you want to apply the voice effect to start streaming. That’s it!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember to select the “Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDMI)” on the application on which you’ll stream the sound effect. For example, if you’re using Twitch, click Settings, choose Audio, then select this sound input device.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Real-User-Experience"><a href="#Part-III-Real-User-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Part III. Real User Experience"></a>Part III. Real User Experience</h2><p> So, what was our user experience with<strong>AI Voicemod</strong> ? To be honest, Voicemod is one of the best if not the best, voice modulator programs. We were impressed by how easily it picks up sounds on our microphone. The range of voice effects and customization options is also impressive, to say the least. And yes, the platform itself looks stylish and modern.</p><p> But this program’s main drawback comes from its major strength. Although Voicemod is a feature-rich program, beginners might feel intimidated at first. You may need to follow the developer’s guide to connect your microphone appropriately and customize the sound settings. Overall, Voicemod isn’t for green hands, although it’s fun to use once you get the hang of it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977023">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977023">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977023%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977023/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-IV-Pricing-and-Plans"><a href="#Part-IV-Pricing-and-Plans" class="headerlink" title="Part IV.
